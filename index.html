<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Blood of Strangers: Stories from Emergency Medicine</h2><p>Hailed by <i>The Boston Globe </i>as "a compact, faceted gem that shines with intelligence," this remarkable and fascinating book offers an honest, startling, deeply moving depiction of the modern emergency room. The twenty-eight vignettes in <i>The Blood of Strangers</i>, all written by a young E.R. physician and writer based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, seamlessly juxtapose visceral portrayals of real and unedited hospital situations with perceptive and lyrical meditations on the world of medicine--and the world at large.<br><br>All students, scholars, and practitioners of emergency medicine will find this stunning account of life, death, work, and reality in the E.R. both haunting and instructive. <br></p><p>Forget the niceties of plot development and the easy moralizing of the television shows. There's nothing glamorous about a hospital emergency room, that arena where every human flaw and frailty is exposed.<p> Frank Huyler, a physician and poet, offers a sharp view of life-and-death realities. The emergency room, he writes in these affecting vignettes, is a place where the dominant mood is numbness, where doctors and patients alike have seen too much bloodshed and death. As a defensive reaction, Huyler writes, some doctors become addicted to drugs and other pastimes, while others assume arrogant, cavalier, or aloof airs. This is eminently understandable, and Huyler recounts the growing distance in his relationship with patients as "the earlier intimacy I had felt ... began to recede into the task." A fine storyteller, Huyler doesn't shy away from tales in which he comes up short, just as he shakes his head in bemusement at the ways of administrators and chiefs. In one episode, for instance, he writes of treating a comatose patient with aggressive measures under one attending physician's orders, then doing almost nothing under another's instructions. The patient "was gone from the waking world, as nearly dead as a human being can be, lying at the edge but never quite crossing over"--but, amazingly, he survived both his injuries and the conflict between the two doctors.</p><p> Reminiscent of the surgeon-essayist Richard Seltzer's best work, Huyler's memoirs take readers behind the surgical screen. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Frank Huyler</b> is an emergency physician living in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

He endorsed the idea, proposed a century earlier by the great Catholic astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, that the earth is not the center of the solar system. In fact, said Galileo, it is the other way around: The sun sits at the center, and the earth is simply one of a handful of planets that revolve around it. </p><p> This idea was judged as being diametrically opposed to the position taken by Holy Scripture. Galileo was forced to publicly recant his views, and his book containing the offending idea, <i>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems,</i> was banned. The old man's sentence was later commuted to house arrest, and he lived out the rest of his days confined to his villa outside Florence, where he eventually went blind. </p><p> Still, Galileo's views persisted, and the meticulous experiments and mathematical models he used in his search to understand nature set the stage for all the developments of modern science that followed. Three centuries later, a German physicist named Albert Einstein called him "the father of modern science." </p><p> For more than a thousand years leading up to the time of Galileo, science had been more interested in creating intellectually satisfying descriptions of reality than in trying to see if those descriptions could be supported by proof. But with the age of Copernicus and Galileo, European scientists began the vigorous pursuit of empirical evidence. Thought experiments gave way to actual physical experiments, such as the famous moment when Galileo dropped two objects from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to test out Aristotle's assertion that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects. (They don't.) </p><p> From Galileo's time onward, scientists' precise observations contributed to a picture of the world that looked very much like a massive piece of mechanical clockwork; they had little practical use for such ideas as soul, spirit, or consciousness. The French philosopher and mathematician Ren� Descartes, a contemporary of Galileo's who is today regarded as "the father of modern philosophy," declared that the best way to understand how the world works would be to divide existence into two parts: the objective or material world, governed by the principles of science, and the subjective world of the mind and the soul, which would be the province of the church. </p><p> Descartes is especially famous for the statement <i>I think, therefore I am.</i> But the truth is, the <i>think</i> part of that declaration puzzled Descartes, much as it has puzzled scientists for centuries since. Just how is it that we think? Where do our thoughts come from? How do the bits of physical matter that constitute our brains generate consciousness? As contemporary physicist John Hagelin has said, "There is a deep philosophical problem surrounding how you get consciousness out of a hunk of meat." </p><p> Despite Descartes' neat division of reality, common sense suggested that our thoughts must be connected to the rest of existence somehow. But how, exactly? The answers to those questions open up a tremendous new world of possibility for what we can achieve in our lives, and they form a central part of The Answer. </p><p> </p><p> </p> A WORLD INSIDE THE ATOM <p> </p><p> In the generations following Galileo and Descartes, Sir Isaac Newton took the idea of nature-as-machine much further, detailing the precise laws that govern how that machine operates. All of classical physics, and in fact, all of modern science, has been built upon the foundation created by Newton, who described a universe of empty, three-dimensional space, through which physical objects move according to immutable laws. These laws of motion made possible the advance of modern technology, from simple steam engines to the space probes that have analyzed soil samples on Mars. </p><p> What we have been able to accomplish by applying Newton's laws has been truly astonishing. But scientists eventually reached the limits of the Newtonian worldview. As their tools grew more sophisticated, their explorations of the physical world took them deep into the heart of the atom, where the nature of reality proved to be something quite different from anything Descartes or Newton ever imagined. </p><p> At the dawn of the twentieth century, the tidy, objective, mechanistic view of the world began to fall apart. With the discovery of radioactivity in the late 1890s, scientists began looking into the world within the atomic nucleus, and they were shocked to discover that on the subatomic level, the physical world did not behave at all the way Newton said it should. In fact, the "atom" itself turned out to be a sort of illusion: The closer scientists looked, the less it really appeared to be there. </p><p> Coined in ancient Greece, the term atom means "indivisible unit," and through the nineteenth century, scientists believed that our entire physical universe was composed of these elementary particles. But radioactivity showed us that the atom was divisible after all -- in fact, there was a whole new world of phenomena inside the atom, waiting to be explored, measured, and described. And when our vision of the atom fractured, the foundation of classical physics fractured along with it. Our view of how the world works was in for a radical transformation. </p><p> </p><p> </p> EVERYTHING IS ENERGY <p> </p><p> When we say the name <i>Albert Einstein,</i> what comes to mind? Perhaps you think of his wild mane of white hair, or that famous picture of the distinguished physicist sticking out his tongue. Or maybe you think simply, "Genius." But whatever picture you have, you will also probably come up with "E=MC2." Why on earth would a mathematical equation for a sophisticated theory be so famous that even nonscientists recognize it immediately? Because with that simple equation, "Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared," Einstein shattered centuries of thinking and radically altered our view of how the world works. </p><p> In his effort to explain the puzzling behavior of light, Einstein found the only viable solution was to stop looking within the neat framework of Newtonian physics. Instead, he introduced his own picture of how the world works: the theory of relativity. One reason Einstein's idea was so transformative was that for the first time ever, it described how energy and matter are not only related, but can be <i>transformed back and forth into each other.</i> A chink had been found in the wall separating the worlds of matter and energy. Now the elegant, clear-cut world of classical, Newtonian physics would be forced to move over and make room for the fuzzy, strange, nearly unimaginable world of <i>quantum physics.</i> </p><p> Quantum physics is the study of how the world works on the smallest scale, at a level far smaller than the atom. And as scientists studied the nature of reality on a smaller and smaller scale, something strange began to happen: The deeper we went into reality, the more it seemed to dissolve from view. The search for the smallest known particle of matter had instead turned up distinct yet elusive little packets of energy, which physicists called <i>quanta.</i> </p><p> The Einstein breakthrough comes down to this: <i>Everything is energy.</i> A rock, a planet, a glass of water, your hand, everything you can touch, taste, or smell -- it's all made of molecules, which are made of atoms, which are made of protons and electrons and neutrons, which are made of nothing but vibrating packets of energy. </p><p> This is where quantum physics intersects with what I found inside that cardboard box. What physicists found has everything to do with how you are going to create the life of your dreams by building your dream business. For once we know that everything is energy -- that there is no absolute distinction between matter and energy -- then the boundaries between the physical world and the world of our thoughts start to disappear as well. </p><p> </p><p> </p> READING THE MIND OF GOD <p> </p><p> In the decades that followed Einstein's theory of relativity, the new quantum physics began to reveal some very strange things. The tiny packets of energy known as quanta exhibited some very peculiar behaviors, including an unexplainable ability to influence one another, a property called <i>entanglement.</i> </p><p> In his book <i>Science and the Akashic Field,</i> physicist Ervin Laszlo describes a series of experiments conducted by lie detector expert Cleve Backster. Backster took some white blood cells from the mouths of his subjects and cultured them in a test tube. He then moved the cultures to distant locations, more than seven miles away. He attached lie detectors to the cultures and then performed a series of experiments on his subjects. </p><p> In one of his tests, he showed his subject a television program depicting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. This man was a former navy gunner who had actually been present at Pearl Harbor during the attack. When the face of a navy gunner appeared on the screen, the man's face betrayed an emotional reaction -- and at that precise moment, the lie detector's needle seven and a half miles away jumped, <i>exactly as it would have had it been attached to the man himself,</i> and not just to a test tube of his cultured white blood cells miles away. </p><p> Subsequent experiments varied the circumstances and increased the distances involved to dozens and even hundreds of miles, with the same astonishing results. </p><p> How is such a thing possible? In the language of quantum physics, the particles of the gunner's body are still connected or "entangled" with one another, and no matter how far apart they are separated in space, they will continue to influence one another. In fact, this effect appears to occur at speeds faster than the speed of light, which violates one of Einstein's basic rules. </p><p> Scientists dubbed this mind-boggling capacity for inst...</p></p><h2>The Ages of Lulu: A Novel</h2><p>At just fifteen years old, Lulu, a "round, hungry little girl," finds that her erotic cravings are already powerfully established when she is seduced by a family friend, Pablo, twelve years her senior. This initial encounter incites the violent power play that drives an adult Lulu through a series of increasingly titillating sexual exploits. Always fascinated by the thin line separating decency and morality from perversion, Lulu gains the courage to explore the darker side of her carnal desires&#x2014;but as her forays become increasingly desperate, the world of illicit and dangerous sex threatens to engulf her completely. <br>A groundbreaking novel of sexual exploration, The Ages of Lulu sparked international controversy and was an overnight sensation when it was first published in Spain fifteen years ago. It won the Sonrisa Vertical Prize for erotic fiction, and was made into a film starring Javier Bardem.</p><p>A young Frenchwoman goes to work in a butcher&#39;s shop during her college vacation. Every day the butcher whispers obscenities in her ear, describing their imagined lovemaking. And as the summer heat takes hold, so does her lust.

One major topic of the book is the encounter between feminism &amp; art history. Having put images of women on the agenda of cultural analysis, feminist interventions in the theory &amp; analysis of representation have created a diverse &amp; intricate field of interpretation which now supersedes that formulation. These essays challenge art history to confront issues of spectatorship, the interface of class &amp; gender, identification &amp; the politics of vision. This illustrated collection is thus a major contribution to debates on representation &amp; sexuality.</p><p></p><h2>The Matarese Circle</h2><p>An international circle of killers, the Matarese will undoubtedly take over the world within just two years.

He was a failure as a soldier, incompetent at dealing with state business, and dominated by his wife. But his influence on the cultural life of Japan was unparalleled. According to Donald Keene, Yoshimasa was the only shogun to leave a lasting heritage for the entire Japanese people.<br><br>Today Yoshimasa is remembered primarily as the builder of the Temple of the Silver Pavilion and as the ruler at the time of the Onin War (1467&#x2013;1477), after which the authority of the shogun all but disappeared. Unable to control the daimyos&#x2015;provincial military governors&#x2015;he abandoned politics and devoted himself to the quest for beauty. It was then, after Yoshimasa resigned as shogun and made his home in the mountain retreat now known as the Silver Pavilion, that his aesthetic taste came to define that of the Japanese: the no theater flourished, Japanese gardens were developed, and the tea ceremony had its origins in a small room at the Silver Pavilion. Flower arrangement, ink painting, and <i>shoin-zukuri</i> architecture began or became of major importance under Yoshimasa. Poets introduced their often barely literate warlord-hosts to the literary masterpieces of the past and taught them how to compose poetry. Even the most barbarous warlord came to want the trappings of culture that would enable him to feel like a civilized man.<br><br><i>Yoshimasa and the Silver Pavilion</i> gives this long-neglected but critical period in Japanese history the thorough treatment it deserves.</p><p>During Yoshimasa's reign, the aesthetic taste of the Japanese was shaped: the n� theater flourished, Japanese gardens were developed, and the tea ceremony had its origins in a small room at the Silver Pavilion.

In his first book, The Daily Adventures of Mixerman , the author detailed the frustrating and often hilarious goings on during the process of recording a major-label band. Musicians, engineers, and producers laughed and cried at the crazy goings-on they&#39;d never imagined or recognized all too well. Now Mixerman turns his razor-sharp gaze to the art of mixing and gives followers and the uninitiated reason to hope if not for logic and civility in the recording studio then at least for a good sounding record. With a firm commitment to art over technology and to maintaining a grasp of each, Mixerman outlines his own approach to recording success, based on his years mixing records in all genres of music for all kinds of artists, often under trying circumstances. As he states in his introduction to the new volume, &#34;Even if you&#39;re not a professional mixer, even if you&#39;re a musician trying to mix your own work or a studio owner in a smaller market, you have your own set of pressures to deal with while you&#39;re mixing. Regardless of what those pressures are, it&#39;s important to identify and recognize them, if for no other reason than so you can learn to completely ignore them.&#34; But how? &#34;That&#39;s where the Zen comes in.&#34;</p><p><i>"Finally, a book that teaches the Art of great mixing, not the pseudoscience. At long f*#@ing last."</i> -Ken Scott (The Beatles, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, Elton John)<br> <br>Here, in a replica of this recently exhumed tome (miraculously preserved within the chassis of a Sound Tools rig at the bottom of The La Brea Tarpits), we present Mixerman's philosophies on the art of mixing. Well known for his hilarious recording exploits in <i>The Daily Adventures of Mixerman</i>, the author now provides his tactical reasoning without the colored lens of absurdist big-label disasters. <br> <br>In this work, Mixerman distills a successful mixing career's worth of lessons and realizations into understandable and sensible terms for both enthusiastic musician and professional technician alike. As Mixerman points out, "If you change how you <i>think</i> about mixing, you'll be well on your way to learning<i> how</i> to mix." <br><br><i>I never thought anybody could write a meaningful book about mixing but Mixerman has done exactly that. I learned early-on that great recording engineering and mixing is largely a matter of keeping your mind out of the way and here is one man's brilliant approach to accomplishing precisely that</i>. -Bob Olhsson (Stevie Wonder, Jackson Five)<br><br> <i> </i><i>"Without belaboring the technical, he encompasses the creative, spiritual, practical, and business aspects in a simple and entertaining read.

Buddha revolutionized the religious ideas of his time to advocate a new way of living. All that is known about him comes from a collection of ancient writings that fuse history, biography and myth. Karen Armstrong distils from these the key events of Buddha&#39;s life: his birth as Siddhatta Gotama in the fifth century BC and his abandonment of his wife and son; his attainment of enlightenment under the Banyan tree; his political influence; the divisions among his followers; and his serene death. Armstrong also introduces the key tenets of Buddhism. In our own age of secular anxiety, she shows that it has profound lessons to teach about selflessness and the simple life.</p><p>Books on Buddhism may overflow the shelves, but the life story of the Buddha himself has remained obscure despite over 2,500 years of influence on millions of people around the world. In an attempt to rectify this, and to make the Buddha and Buddhism accessible to Westerners, the beloved scholar and author of such sweeping religious studies as <i>A History of God</i> has written a readable, sophisticated, and somewhat unconventional biography of one of the most influential people of all time. Buddha himself fought against the cult of personality, and the Buddhist scriptures were faithful, giving few details of his life and personality. Karen Armstrong mines these early scriptures, as well as later biographies, then fleshes the story out with an explanation of the cultural landscape of the 6th century B.C., creating a deft blend of biography, history, philosophy, and mythology.<p> At the age of 29, Siddhartha Gautama walked away from the insulated pleasure palace that had been his home and joined a growing force of wandering monks searching for spiritual enlightenment during an age of upheaval. Armstrong traces Gautama's journey through yoga and asceticism and grounds it in the varied religious teachings of the time. In many parts of the world during this so-called axial age, new religions were developing as a response to growing urbanization and market forces. Yet each shared a common impulse--they placed faith increasingly on the individual who was to seek inner depth rather than magical control. Taoism and Confucianism, Hinduism, monotheism in the Middle East and Iran, and Greek rationalism were all emerging as Gautama made his determined way towards enlightenment under the boddhi tree and during the next 45 years that he spent teaching along the banks of the Ganges. Armstrong, in her intelligent and clarifying style, is quick to point out the Buddha's relevance to our own time of transition, struggle, and spiritual void in both his approach--which was based on skepticism and empiricism--and his teachings. </p><p> Despite the lack of typical historical documentation, Armstrong has written a rich and revealing description of both a unique time in history and an unusual man. <i>Buddha</i> is a terrific primer for those interested in the origins and fundamentals of Buddhism. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>Karen Armstrong spent seven years as a Roman Catholic nun, an experience she recollected in her two volumes of best-selling autobiography, Through the Narrow Gate and Beginning the World. She is the author of the world-wide best-seller, A History of God (which has now appeared in more than thirty languages), the acclaimed History of Jerusalem and, most recently, The Battle for God.

But when they follow up a new lead, it takes them to an old, unexpected foe - the Lambs.<br><br><em>"We spot the werewolves as we skim the treetops. Mutated, vicious, hairy monstrosities, all fangs, claws and muscles. The beast within me tries to force its way to the surface, howling silently at its warped brethren. I've never rid myself of the wolf..."<br><br></em><br></p><p>"I was born in London in 1972 and moved to Ireland when I was 6 years old, where I've lived ever since. I always wanted to be a writer - I've loved telling stories since I was a child. I started out writing books for adults, and managed to get a couple published. One day, on a whim, I decided to try a book for children. The result was <em>Cirque Du Freak</em>. Much to my surprise, it took off, and I became a de facto children's author! Since then I've used my ill-gotten gains to buy lots of comic-strip art and travel the world. When I'm not working or traveling, I like watching movies. I've even been known to read the odd book or two." <br><br>Darren is working on his ninth novel in the bone-chilling <em>Demonata</em> series, coming in November 2009.Grade 7&#x2013;10&#x2014;Grubbs Grady, his magical mentor Beranabus, and their ally Kernel-all featured in previous volumes&#x2014;battle their way through the alternate worlds of demons and other creepy creatures. They kill all the demons they can while hoping to learn more about the monstrous power that propels the demon forces to slaughter humanity. The teenager Grubbs, as readers know from earlier installments, carries a family curse that could turn him into a werewolf, and it takes all of his magical talents to keep that curse at bay. If that happens, he will be hunted down and killed by a group called the Lambs. When fellow demon-fighters Meera and Shark appear through a window from the human world, they ask for help. Grubbs's beloved Uncle Dervish has been attacked by werewolves and is near death, and the Lambs may have allied with Lord Loss, the series' main villain. Grubbs and the other demon fighters learn that things are worse than they thought (in the "Demonata" books, they always are)&#x2014;the Lambs are now breeding werewolves at Wolf Island, a remote lab and fortress. Like all of the books in this series, <i>Wolf Island</i> is not for the squeamish; blood and death are gruesome constants and triumphs are only temporary.&#x2014;<i>Walter Minkel, Austin Public Library, TX</i> END</p><h2>Lambert The Sheepish Lion</h2><p>A lion is very sheepish and learns to overcome that.</p><p></p><h2>If You&#39;re Afraid of the Dark, Remember the Night Rainbow</h2><p>"If tomorrow morning the sky <p>falls...have clouds for breakfast. </p> <p>If you have butterflies in </p> <p>your stomach...ask them into your heart."</p> <p>...such are the unconventional solutions offered to life&#x2019;s problems in <i>If You&#x2019;re Afraid of the Dark, Remember the Night Rainbow</i>.

They had been middle school misfits, bonded by braces and a love of fantasy and science fiction. But time, different lifestyles, and peer pressure interferred. He became the "Prince of Jocks," while she remained an introverted loner. When he suddenly rekindles their friendship, Lauren is wary until she realizes that Spencer is deeply troubled and values the honesty and camaraderie they once shared. As their romance intensifies, he confides that he is haunted by his father's suicide and disturbed by his pretentious lifestyle and uncommunicative mother. Drunk and depressed on graduation night, he is nearly killed in a motorcycle accident. His physical, psychological, and emotional healing begins with devoted Lauren by his side. The couple confronts modern perils of youth--sex, alcohol, and suicide--with little adult intervention. Lauren's divorced mother is sympathetic but distracted by her own romantic involvement. Spencer's mother and stepfather are more concerned with social appearances than reality. Mr. Walker, their English teacher, dismisses the young man's poetic perception of death as plagiarism. Stereotype characters abound; and, the nearly tragic climax is a long time coming. Nonetheless, YA readers will identify with the pressures, conflicts, and concerns facing these teens.

His skepticism was eroded, however, when she began to channel messages from the "space between lives," which contained remarkable revelations about Dr. Weiss' family and his dead son. Using past-life therapy, he was able to cure the patient and embark on a new, more meaningful phase of his own career.</p><p>Psychiatry and metaphysics blend together in this fascinating book based on a true case history. Dr. Weiss, who was once firmly entrenched in a clinical approach to psychiatry, finds himself reluctantly drawn into past-life therapy when a hypnotized client suddenly reveals details of her previous lives. During one hypnosis session his client introduces the spirit guides who have been her soul therapists in between lives. This is when the story really takes off for Weiss, who discovers that these guides have specific messages about his dead son as well as Weiss's mission in life. No, we cannot verify the truth of this story using the limited scientific tools we have available.

Now, in this hard-hitting memoir, Burton emerges from the shadows to reveal who he is, what he has accomplished, and the threats that lurk unseen except by an experienced, world-wise few.<br><br>In the mid-eighties, the idea of defending Americans against terrorism was still new. But a trio of suicide bombings in Beirut&#x2013;including one that killed 241 marines and forced our exit from Lebanon&#x2013;had changed the mindset and mission of the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), the arm of the State Department that protects U.S. embassy officials across the globe. Burton, a member of DSS&#x2019;s tiny but elite Counterterrorism Division, was plunged into a murky world of violent religious extremism spanning the streets of Middle Eastern cities and the informant-filled alleys of American slums. From battling Libyan terrorists and their Palestinian surrogates to having facing down hijackers, hostages, and Hezbollah double agents, Burton found himself on the front lines of America&#x2019;s first campaign against Terror.<br><br>In this globe-trotting account of one counterterrorism agent&#x2019;s life and career, Burton takes us behind the scenes to reveal how the United States tracked Libya-linked master terrorist Abu Nidal; captured Ramzi Yusef, architect of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; and pursued the assassins of major figures including Yitzhak Rabin, Meir Kahane, and General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the president of Pakistan&#x2013;classic cases that have sobering new meaning in the treacherous years since 9/11.

Then they probe our lives and backgrounds in search of weaknesses, skeletons, or any sort of leverage by which to exploit or co-opt us. Sooner or later, they will make contact with an offer. Or a threat.<br><br>I glance behind me, half expecting to see some Eastern Bloc thug in a trench coat shadowing me. But all I see is a thin layer of fog and an empty suburban block.<br><br>I look behind me a lot these days. It goes with the job. Situational awareness is essential if we are to stay alive. I don't run with a Walkman banging out Springsteen's Born to Run anymore. My ears are unbound and tuned to the street. Every little sound, every shuffle or distant downshift of an automobile on MacArthur Boulevard registers with me. I file each new noise away in my mind, cataloging it so I'll notice anything out of the ordinary. I've been trained to be an observer. Since I started my training last November, I hone and refine this skill on every morning run.<br><br>Tyler picks up the pace. She's taking me toward Glen Echo, a small town on the Potomac. We reach a little jogging trail that runs along Reservoir Road. Here, we escape the suburbs and plunge into the woods. Just before we enter the tree line, I steal a sidelong glance behind me again. I practice this move every day; it is something we learned in training. The trick is to be unobtrusive, to not reveal that you're clearing your six. It has become automatic for me now.<br><br>No tails. We're not being followed.<br><br>Today my life changes forever. I have no idea what is in store for us new guys. I just know that a year ago, I was a Maryland cop. I protected my community. I loved law enforcement, but I wanted something more. So I applied for federal service, and the Diplomatic Security Service offered me a job. Until last fall, I'd never even heard of the DSS.<br><br>I started my training in November 1985, just a few weeks after terrorists hijacked the cruise liner Achille Lauro and executed Leon Klinghoffer for the crime of being an American citizen-and a Jew. They shot him then dumped him overboard in his wheelchair.<br><br>The world needs more cops.<br><br>Only three out of every hundred who start the training get to the finish line. I felt lucky just to be there. After the ceremony, we stood in alphabetically arranged lines waiting to receive our first assignments. Our class coordinator, Special Agent Phil Whitney, began reading off our names and telling us what we'd be doing for the next phase of our lives. Some of us picked up overseas assignments in our embassy field offices. Some landed protective security tours, guarding our diplomats and the secretary of state. Whitney told a few they'd be assigned as diplomatic couriers, where they would carry our nation's most-guarded secrets from one place to another all around the globe.<br><br>When he got to me, Whitney paused. He stared at his clipboard for a moment before saying, "Burton, Counterterrorism Branch."<br><br>I'd had no idea what that was. When Whitney reached the middle of the alphabet he called out, "Mullen, Counterterrorism Branch."<br><br>I looked down the rows of agents to John Mullen. His flaming red hair was easy to spot. I could see him searching me out. We were the only two to be sent to this puzzling assignment. We exchanged confused glances. What had we gotten into?<br><br>At least I'd be going into it with a rock-steady veteran. Before he joined the DSS, Mullen had been an agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration, battling the growing narco-criminal element and cocaine cartels on the streets of New York City. Legend had it that he'd been in a nasty shoot-out and had run out of ammunition in the midst of the fray. After that, he always carried two guns. One he tucked away in a shoulder holster. The other he wore strapped to his ankle. He prepared for the worst and trusted in firepower. I swear we all thought he slept with those weapons. They were his pacifiers.<br><br>A light rain drizzles down on us now. Tyler shakes her coat in midstride, sending water droplets flying. I wish I could do that. We're still on a course that is taking us away from our little redbrick apartment, a fact that I sense is starting to disappoint my dog. I hurry forward until I'm even with her and bend down to run my hands through her damp fur. She looks up at me with pure love. I've already told my wife that when I die, Tyler's ashes will be buried with me.<br><br>Back home, my wife, Sharon, is probably just getting up to face her own Monday. We were high school sweethearts and have known each other most of our lives. Up until now, we've lived an average DINK life (Double Income, No Kids). She's an accountant, a damned good one. She's aggressive and driven and works long hours. Now, I'm a spook. Secrecy is our watchword. I realize with a grin that we'll have nothing to talk about at cocktail parties.<br><br>Tyler Beauregard dashes ahead of me again until she reaches a narrow footbridge. She waits for me to catch up. She knows this bridge. We've investigated it before. It is top on the list of Dark World sites to see in Washington, D.C. Of course, there are no plaques or markers noting this piece of spy history. To the average workaday American-guys like me until four months ago-it was just a little bridge over a small creek.<br><br>But now I know its dark side. This was Kim Philby's dead-drop point. Philby was the KGB's first true superspy, a British intel operative who embraced Communism while at Oxford in the thirties. He compromised hundreds of agents, destroyed scores of operations, and sold out the lives of countless patriots. When his cover was finally blown in the sixties, he escaped to Moscow and got what he deserved: a hellish life under the regime he had helped sustain. In the dingy concrete apartments he later called home, he devolved into a bitter, broken alcoholic given to frequent bouts of complete incoherence. His conscience became his enemy. He died in shame, his name a byword for treason.<br><br>In the late 1940s, Philby was posted to Washington, D.C. It was said that he somehow learned the true size of our atomic stockpile, which was not large at the time. He passed that vital tidbit of national security on to the KGB by taping a tube full of documents under this bridge. Legend has it that the information the Russians retrieved here emboldened Stalin to blockade Berlin in 1948.<br><br>This is my world now. The days of chasing speeders, driving drunken high school kids home, and taking down burglars is over. At least for me.<br><br>Tyler senses I'm brooding and sets off again. This is her way of telling me it is time to return to the warmth of our apartment. I trail along behind her, my breathing easy. As I watch her galloping for home, it strikes me that she too has a connection to the Dark World. She's from Winchester, Virginia. I bought her from a breeder there in town when she was just a pup. That's John Mosby country. He was a Confederate colonel, a renegade guerrilla nicknamed the "Gray Ghost" who struck terror into the hearts of Union rear-area types during the height of the Civil War.<br><br>Now I'm counterterror. Whatever that means. I suppose like every American who watches the evening news, I've seen Americans abroad fall victim to political violence. One terror attack after another has darkened the nightly broadcasts-the Achille Lauro, plane hijackings, car bombings, Beirut. We're a nation still scarred by the Iran hostage crisis and that 444-day nightmare. Will I be fighting against this sort of criminal now? I'm not sure, but I hope so.<br><br>Time to find out. We run through the morning, never retracing our steps. Periodically, I check my rear. No KGB agent picks up my tail. When we reach the apartment, we're still alone. A half hour out in the neighborhood and we never saw another soul. It is refreshing to have such privacy.<br><br>A quick shower and a hastily downed breakfast soon follow our arrival home. I dress carefully. I toss my Casio watch onto the nightstand. I use it only for running. In its place, I strap on a black-faced Rolex Submariner. There's no way I could afford such a luxury at retail price on my salary. A government special agent makes $22,000. But on our honeymoon to the Virgin Islands a few years ago, I snagged this one for $750.<br><br>In the closet, I find my Jos. A. Bank suit. Brown. Standard spook issue. The company gives us agents a discount. I button up a white dress shirt and throw on the one thing that will give me any distinction among my colleagues: a duck-patterned Orvis tie. No sense in totally obliterating my identity with my government threads...</p><h2>Modern Classics Room of Ones Own (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>Collecting two book-length essays, A Room of One&#39;s Own and Three Guineas is Virginia Woolf&#39;s most powerful feminist writing, justifying the need for women to possess intellectual freedom and financial independence. This Penguin Modern Classics edition is edited with an introduction and notes by Michele Barrett. A Room of One&#39;s Own, based on a lecture given at Girton College, Cambridge, is one of the great feminist polemics, ranging in its themes from Jane Austen and Carlotte Bront� to the silent fate of Shakespeare&#39;s gifted (imaginary) sister and the effects of poverty and sexual constraint on female creativity. Three Guineas was published almost a decade later and breaks new ground in its discussion of men, militarism and women&#39;s attitudes towards war. These two pieces reveal Virginia Woolf&#39;s fiery spirit and sophisticated wit, and confirm her status as a highly inspirational essayist. Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) is regarded as a major 20th century author and essayist, a key figure in literary history as a feminist and modernist, and the centre of &#39;The Bloomsbury Group&#39;. This informal collective of artists and writers which included Lytton Strachey and Roger Fry, exerted a powerful influence over early twentieth-century British culture. Between 1925 and 1931 Virginia Woolf produced what are now regarded as her finest masterpieces, from Mrs Dalloway (1925) to the poetic and highly experimental novel The Waves (1931). She also maintained an astonishing output of literary criticism, short fiction, journalism and biography, including the playfully subversive Orlando (1928) and A Room of One&#39;s Own (1929) a passionate feminist essay. If you enjoyed A Room of One&#39;s Own, you might like Woolf&#39;s Orlando, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;Probably the most influential piece of non-fictional writing by a woman in this century&#39; Hermione Lee, Financial Times</p><p>Surprisingly, this long essay about society and art and sexism is one of Woolf&#39;s most accessible works. Woolf, a major modernist writer and critic, takes us on an erudite yet conversational--and completely entertaining--walk around the history of women in writing, smoothly comparing the architecture of sentences by the likes of William Shakespeare and Jane Austen, all the while lampooning the chauvinistic state of university education in the England of her day. When she concluded that to achieve their full greatness as writers women will need a solid income and a privacy, Woolf pretty much invented modern feminist criticism.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

The versatile power of these ornamental designs, and hence their use as a source of inspiration for designers and craftspeople of all kinds, is revealed to the full in this step-by-step guide. Celtic mazes belong to an ancient class of spiral ornament which Celtic artists of the early middle ages developed with unequalled ingenuity and virtuosity. These patterns can even be drawn freehand following the method described here - a technique used by the ancient masters, now rediscovered and clearly illustrated for the first time. The beauty and simplicity of the designs makes them an ideal introduction to Celtic art, comprising delightful calligraphy and illumination which everyone can produce for themselves.</p><p></p><h2>Parables of the Christ-Life (Illustrated Edition) (Dodo Press)</h2><p>This anthology is a thorough introduction to classic literature for those who have not yet experienced these literary masterworks. For those who have known and loved these works in the past, this is an invitation to reunite with old friends in a fresh new format. From Shakespeare s finesse to Oscar Wilde s wit, this unique collection brings together works as diverse and influential as The Pilgrim s Progress and Othello. As an anthology that invites readers to immerse themselves in the masterpieces of the literary giants, it is must-have addition to any library.</p><p>Isabella Lilias Trotter (1853&#x2013;1928) was an artist and a Christian missionary for over 38 years to the Muslims of Algeria. She wrote several books illustrated by herself, including Parables of the Cross, Parables of the Christ Life, and a book for Sufi Muslims The Way of the Sevenfold Secret. First published in a periodical, and later as a booklet, "Focussed" inspired Helen Lemmel to write of the now famous hymn "The Heavenly Vision" (often referred to by the first line of its refrain, "Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus").</p><h2>Guilty Thing: A Life of Thomas De Quincey</h2><p><p><b>National Book Critics Circle Award, </b><b>Biographers International Organization Plutarch Award and <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize Finalist</b></p><p><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i>, <i>Times Literary Supplement </i>and <i>The Guardian</i> Best Books of 2016</b></p><p>Thomas De Quincey was an obsessive. He was obsessed with Wordsworth and Coleridge, whose <i>Lyrical Ballads </i>provided the script to his life, and by the idea of sudden death. Running away from school to pursue the two poets, De Quincey insinuated himself into their world. Basing his sensibility on Wordsworth&#x2019;s and his character on Coleridge&#x2019;s, he forged a triangle of unusual psychological complexity.</p><p>Aged twenty-four, De Quincey replaced Wordsworth as the tenant of Dove Cottage, the poet&#x2019;s former residence in Grasmere. In this idyllic spot he followed the reports of the notorious Ratcliffe Highway murders of 1811, when two families, including a baby, were butchered in their own homes. In his opium-soaked imagination the murderer became a poet while the poet became a murderer. Embedded in <i>On Murder as One of the Fine Arts</i>, De Quincey&#x2019;s brilliant series of essays, Frances Wilson finds the startling story of his relationships with Wordsworth and Coleridge.</p><p>Opium was the making of De Quincey, allowing him to dissolve self-conflict, eliminate self-recrimination, and divest himself of guilt. Opium also allowed him to write, and under the pseudonym &#x201c;The Opium-Eater&#x201d; De Quincey emerged as the strangest and most original journalist of his age. His influence has been considerable. Poe became his double; Dostoevsky went into exile with <i>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</i> in his pocket; and Charles Dickens, Oscar Wilde, George Orwell, Alfred Hitchcock, and Vladimir Nabokov were all De Quincey devotees. </p><p>There have been other biographies of Thomas De Quincey, but <i>Guilty Thing</i> is the first to be animated by the spirit of De Quincey himself. Following the growth of his obsessions from seed to full flowering and tracing the ways they intertwined, Frances Wilson finds the master key to De Quincey&#x2019;s vast Piranesian mind. Unraveling a tale of hero worship and revenge, <i>Guilty Thing</i> brings the last of the Romantics roaring back to life and firmly establishes Wilson as one of our foremost contemporary biographers.</p></p><p><b>Frances Wilson</b> is a critic, a journalist, and the author of several works of nonfiction, including <i>Literary Seductions</i>; <i>The Courtesan&#x2019;s Revenge</i>; <i>The Ballad of Dorothy Wordsworth</i>, which won the Rose Mary Crawshay Prize in 2009; <i>How to Survive the </i>Titanic, the winner of the Elizabeth Longford Prize for Historical Biography in 2012, and <i>Guilty Thing: A Life of Thomas De Quincey</i>, which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in 2016.

Love and hate. Frances Wilson delicately flavors her biography of the early-19th-century writer with both condiments but, above all, without censure . . . ." &#x2015;John Sutherland, <i>The</i> <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"She has set out, with immense energy and flait, to 'hunt' De Quincey 'though all his doubles,' and unlike previous biographers . . . Wilson [is] especially prepared for the ambiguous, shape-shifting, changeling, illusive quality in De Quincey. She sees the need for stylistic fireworks as well as steady scholarship to illuminate his life. She writes with speed, flamboyance, and constant changes of viewpoint and perspective, offset by moments of calm, shrewd analysis . . [A] risky, sprightly, passionate biography, which goes further than anything previously in catching the strange, elusive Opium Eater." &#x2015;Richard Holmes, <i>New York Review of Books</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"In <i>Guilty Thing</i>, her entertaining, intellectually brilliant biography of De Quincey, Frances Wilson is just as truthful and evocative as her subject." &#x2015;Jamie James, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"Wildly entertaining . . . Wilson renders De Quincey's life with extraordinary sympathy and sensitivity, a beautifully written account of one of our oddest writers." &#x2015;Kate Tuttle, <i>The Boston Globe</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"[<i>Guilty Thing</i>] eschews the traditional modes of biography&#x2015;the recitation of a life&#x2019;s arc, its major milestones, and an even-tempered portrayal&#x2015;in favor of something as death-haunted and murder-obsessed as De Quincey himself . . . Wilson&#x2019;s prose is at its best . . . when she mirrors and amplifies De Quincey&#x2019;s own style . . . <i>Guilty Thing </i>is less unruly but still captures that propulsion that drives De Quincey&#x2019;s greatest writings . . ." &#x2015;Colin Dickey, <i>The New Republic</i></p><p>"Frances Wilson's smart new biography of De Quincey, <i>Guilty Thing</i>, judiciously narrates the life of a writer who responded to the question 'How cam you to dream more splendidly than others?' with the answer 'He whose talk is of oxen, will probably dream of oxen.' . . . With the recent publication of a new <i>Works of Thomas De Quincey </i>and scholarly biographies by Grevel Lindop and Robert Morrison, perhaps attention is being redirected in a promising way. Frances Wilson's book will play no small part in this sublimely pleasant development." &#x2015;Eric Banks, <i>Bookforum</i></p><p>"[A] superb new biography . . . Wilson, who has shown herself to be a remarkable biographer of such strikingly different Romantic figures as the courtesan Harriette Wilson and Dorothy Wordsworth, sees the subterranean influence of the perennially peripheral De Quincey burbling up wherever she looks . . . Wilson is De Quincey&#x2019;s first De Quinceyan biographer. Herself densely allusive, she follows him on his Piranesian stairways with balletic aplomb." &#x2015;Alexandra Mullen, <i>The New Criterion</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"This is a mesmerizing and agile biography of the 19th century English writer, best known for the autobiographical <i>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</i>.

De Quincey's previous biographers have sometimes felt duty bound to be balanced, comprehensive, to play the straight man in a double act with their grotesquely wayward subject. It's something of a relief, then, when Wilson suggests that what we need is not another biography of De Quincey but a 'De Quinceyan biography.' She takes pleasure in her quarry&#x2015;and takes enjoyable risks with him&#x2015;as she tracks him through his various lives . . .

Dubbed the "Nun Study" because it involves a unique population of 678 Catholic sisters, this remarkable long-term research project remains today at the forefront of some of the world's most significant research on aging.<br><br>This remarkable book by one of the world's leading experts on Alzheimer's disease combines fascinating high-tech research on the brain with the heartfelt story of the aging nuns who are teaching scientists how we grow old &#x2014; and how we can do so with grace. The Nun Study's findings are already helping scientists unlock the secrets to living a longer, healthier life.<br><br>Yet <b>Aging With Grace</b> is more than a groundbreaking health and hard-science book. It is the story of an altar boy who grew up to be a scientist studying the effects of aging on nuns. It is the poignant and inspiring stories of the nuns themselves. Ranging in age from 75 to 104, these remarkable women have allowed Dr. Snowdon access to their medical and personal records &#x2014; and they have agreed to donate their brains upon death.<br><br>In <b>Aging With Grace</b>, we accompany Dr. Snowdon on his loving visits to nuns like Sister Clarissa, who at the age of 90 drives around the convent in a motorized cart she calls her "Chevy" and knows as much about baseball as any die-hard fan a third her age.<br><br>Then there is 104-year-old Sister Matthia, who until her death in 1998 knitted two pairs of mittens a day and prayed every evening for each of the four thousand students she taught over the years. These bright, articulate, and altruistic women have much to teach us about how faith, wisdom, and spirituality can influence the length and quality of our lives.<br><br>We also follow Dr. Snowdon into the lab as he and his colleagues race to decode one of the most devastating diseases known to humanity. We discover:<br><br>* Why high linguistic ability in early life seems to protect against Alzheimer's <br>* Which ordinary foods in the diet defend the brain against aging<br>* Why preventing strokes and depression is key to avoiding dementia<br>* Why it's never too late to start an exercise program<br>* What role heredity plays, and how lifestyle can increase our chances for a mentally vital old age<br>* How intangibles like community and faith help us age with grace<br><br>Both cutting-edge science and a personal prescription for hope, <b>Aging With Grace</b> shows how old age doesn't have to mean an inevitable slide into illness and disability; rather, it can be a time of promise and productivity, intellectual and spiritual vigor, and continuing freedom from disease.</p><p>"What distinguishes this study is Snowdon's decision not to maintain the usual "objective" distance from his subjects but rather to become emotionally involved with them. His commitment to treat them with 'care and respect' is readily apparent in the many warm and sympathetic anecdotes and his expression of deeply felt grief when any of the sisters becomes incapacitated by Alzheimer's or dies. ... [R]eaders will certainly appreciate the early insights to be gleaned from Snowdon's human- (rather than statistic-) centered and compassionate story."<br>&#x2014; <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"The Nun Study represents an absolutely unique American treasure and resource for all of us.

She spent her childhood on a large farm there and first came to England in 1949. She brought with her the manuscript of her first novel, The Grass is Singing, which was published in 1950 with outstanding success in Britain, in America, and in ten European countries. Since then her international reputation not only as a novelist but as a non-fiction and short story writer has flourished. For her collection of short novels, Five, she was honoured with the 1954 Somerset Maugham Award. She was awarded the Austrian State Prize for European Literature in 1981, and the German Federal Republic Shakespeare Prize of 1982. Among her other celebrated novels are The Golden Notebook, The Summer Before the Dark and Memoirs of a Survivor. Her short stories have been collected in a number of volumes, including To Room Nineteen and The Temptation of Jack Orkney; while her African stories appear in This Was the Old Chief&#39;s Country and The Sun Between Their Feet. Shikasta, the first in a series of five novels with the overall title of Canopus in Argos: Archives, was published in 1979. Her novel The Good Terrorist won the W. H. Smith Literary Award for 1985, and the Mondello Prize in Italy that year. The Fifth Child won the Grinzane Cavour Prize in Italy, an award voted on by students in their final year at school. The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 was made into an opera with Philip Glass, libretto by the author, and premiered in Houston. London Observed, her latest collection of stories and sketches, was published to wide acclaim in 1992.</p><h2>Scottish Knits: Colorwork &amp; Cables with a Twist</h2><p><p><b>24 exciting and contemporary design projects!

Set against the ship's fateful maiden voyage, Cameron's much-anticipated motion picture epic weaves a rich human tapestry of romance, heroism, tragedy and greed.<p>Within these pages is a detailed look at the monumental effort by thousands of artists and craftsmen to accurately re-create the 'ship of dreams, ' including the full-size exterior replica of the ship and the 17-million-gallon tank facility designed to sink her; a wealth of detailed interior spaces; new discoveries from Cameron's 1995 dives to the wreck, some two-and-a-half miles below the ocean surface; studies of the ornate wardrobe, makeup and hairstyles that defined the look of the 'Gilded Age'; an overview of the film's groundbreaking visual-effects work; and in-depth interviews with cast and crew, all referenced to the historic events of the Titanic's maiden, and final, voyage.</p></p><p><i>James Cameron's Titanic</i> is a book conceived on the epic scale of the movie--not only do the massive page size and sky-high production values of the book do justice to the big ship, they give Kate Winslet's titanic hats an impact comparable to what the big screen gives them. It's also fun to get the effect of exploring a set as vast, complex, and fiscally and physically dangerous as the one Cameron created for <i>Titanic</i> the film. He is Hollywood's answer to Ahab, so he deserves a great big book.<p> Nor will fans be disappointed to hear Winslet break character--she plays an upper-class lass from the stuffiest circles--and explain how she helped her costar prepare for their first scene together, in which she stripped for her dishy portrait. "I was naked in front of Leo on the first day of shooting," says Winslet in the book. "She had no shame with it," says DiCaprio, who apparently despises shame. "She wanted to break the ice a little beforehand, so she flashed me. I wasn't prepared for that, so she had one up on me. I was pretty comfortable after that."</p><p> While the stars were getting acquainted and the wild-eyed director was figuring out historically unprecedented ways of blending live footage with computer imagery ("Cheat the size of the tugboats 10 percent smaller ... It will make the ship look even more majestic as it leaves Southampton!"), the core cast of 150 extras was taking a crash course in manners. Etiquette coach and choreographer Lynne Hockney even taught the Core (as they were called) that there was a proper way to laugh. "It was the Gilded Age, a time of the grand hostess, lavish parties and tireless pleasure-seeking," Hockney says in the book. "And each social class was scrambling to reach the one above it. This made proper behavior terribly important.... You cannot slouch in a corset, for example. You perch." One wishes there was a frame or two from the Hockney film running on a tape loop in the wardrobe building, <i>Titanic Etiquette: A Time-Traveler's Guide</i>.

His non-fiction includes The Great Divide and 100% American. He lives in New York City.A nasty, arch and occasionally funny novel about cockroaches- -first fiction from Weiss, author of nonfiction books 100% American and The Great Divide (not reviewed). In an unnamed city (seems like New York), Ira Fishblatt, a bleeding-heart liberal Legal Aid lawyer, is rejected by his live-in lover, The Gypsy. This is much to the dismay of the other inhabitants of Ira's place: hundreds of cockroaches with names like Bismarck, Rosa Luxemburg, and Julia Child (they were born in bookshelves), who enjoyed The Gypsy's messiness and food-throwing. After a brief despondent period, Ira meets the overweight, matronly Ruth Grubstein. Cosseted into the role of good Jewish boy, Ira goes to such lengths to please Ruth that he renovates the kitchen, forcing the kibitzing circle of Blattelae Germanicae out of their homes. The roaches, led by their ringleader Numbers, who's also the book's narrator, swear vengeance. They disrupt a dinner party of Ira and Ruth and their neighbors, the Wainscotts, by causing a blackout that, in a good bit of screwball writing, forces Ira and Elizabeth Wainscott into close quarters in the dark. But Plan A fails, and thus begins Numbers's long journey of the soul to find a more effective revenge on humankind. What follows are comically gruesome scenes described from Numbers's roachy point of view: from toilets, in Ira and Ruth's bed, in the hair of a coke dealer named Rufus, in the sewer system. Weiss's broad ethnic comedy--in dialogue between Jewish Ira, black Rufus, and old-money racist Wainscott--is bracing at first, then flattens. A well-modulated comic novel (one hesitates to say ``picaresque''), only for those with really, really wicked sensibilities. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But when he explains Le Corbusier's "visual accoustics" or the Wiener Werstatte, it seems safe to assume he envisions a broader audience of consumers who, if made aware of the possibilities, can demand better, more responsible design. As in his Design for the Real World, Papanek derides conspicuous consumption and rapid obsolescence. Using examples drawn from various cultures and other research to bolster his case, he urges designers and architects to incorporate ethics (Does an object help the needy? Does it use scarce resources?) and humanity (Do the light, acoustics and scale foster a sense of well-being?). While Papanek is all for fun in design, he dismisses such senseless elements as add-ons that don't really improve performance (the annoying car voice intoning "your door is ajar") or miniaturization that ignores the limits of the human body. He urges consumers to break the cycle of consumption and be aware of the difference between eye-catching marketing and good design. The Green Imperative itself lacks something in design: it covers so much that the argument is occasionally diffused. Still, Papanek is committed to his subject and becomes almost poetic when discussing Inuit and Balinese design or the necessity of integrating the ephemeral and the permanent. 152 illustrations; 46 in color. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.In his groundbreaking work, <i>Design for the Real World</i> (1971) (still in print and available in 23 languages), Papanek introduced the idea of an ethics of design. Now, 25 environmentally irresponsible years later, he reiterates his plea for ecologically sound design of everything from food packaging to buildings. Designers and architects possess a remarkable ability to blend the demands of aesthetics with those of technology; why not add to that the pursuit of innovative ideas for avoiding pollution and other forms of environmental degradation. And the burden doesn't rest solely on designers: we should all demand products and buildings that are created in harmony with nature. Papanek offers many instructive ways of assessing the environmental impact of various materials and manufacturing processes. He also, in perhaps the book's most intriguing section, discusses how one "senses" a building and how vernacular architecture maintains its close connection to the land it occupies. Much as Papanek expresses concern over environmental problems, he does have hope. We are a species, after all, that seeks challenges and loves novelty. Let's harness those urges and clean up our act. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>THE PIG COMES TO DINNER</h2><p>An Irish castle is haunted by the ghosts of two youths.

Willie replied, "No, I'll get another wife first."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>And that is precisely what happened&#x2014;the wife part, anyway. But the woman Willie married turned out to be a cat woman, and on their first Christmas together, a little white waif found starving in a ditch off old Highway 51 outside Jackson, Mississippi, crept out from behind their Christmas tree with a red Yuletide ribbon around her neck. Willie was horrified, but that kitten eventually became the mother of Spit McGee, who is the subject of this surprising, beguiling, and altogether winning book.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> When Spit McGee was three weeks old, he almost died, but he was saved by Willie with a little help from Clinic Cat, who gave him a blood transfusion. Spit McGee was tied to Willie thereafter, a fount of affection, loyalty, crankiness, and enigma&#x2014;not to mention high and resilient intelligence. Spit has one blue eye and one golden eye. Although folk wisdom has it that a cat with different colored eyes is deaf, Spit McGee, according to Willie, could pick up a dinner conversation in Memphis, two hundred miles away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><b>My Cat Spit McGee</b> vividly describes what Willie learned about cats over the years&#x2014;their habits, eccentricities, and resourcefulness, the ways in which they have been irrevocably shaped by their long-ago jungle origin, and how they differ from dogs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The result is an endearing, story-filled celebration of the love that millions of others have for their cats. It honors, too, an abiding comradeship, and Willie's and Spit's daily adventures as they tried to fathom each other.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><b>My Cat Spit McGee</b> is the memorable sequel to <b>My Dog Skip</b> and one of the finest books ever written about a cat.<br></p><p>"Funny and endearing." --The Washington post book World<br><br>"[Willie Morris is] one of the most beloved writers of the modern South." --The New York Times<br><br>"Remarkably engaging. . . .

As one of America's most influential law professors, Derrick Bell has spent a lifetime helping students struggling to maintain a sense of integrity in the face of an overwhelming pressure to succeed at any price. The result of a meditation on Bell's own achievements, <i>Ethical Ambition</i> is a deeply affecting, uplifting, and thoughtful work that not only challenges us to face some of the most difficult questions that life presents, but also dares to offer solutions.</p></p><p><p><b>Derrick Bell </b>is one of the most highly respected constitutional law scholars practicing today. He teaches at the New York University School of Law, and is the author of seven previous books, including <i>The New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Faces at the Bottom of the Well</i>.</p>These three books take different approaches to the basic question, How can we live a meaningful life? To find an answer, Vanier (Becoming Human) turns to Aristotle, offering a detailed account of his views on the virtues. Vanier shows that Aristotle based his ethics on a cultivation of individual excellence that did not exclude the values of friendship and life in society. Vanier does not, however, wholly embrace Aristotle, arguing that his system was elitist and needs to be corrected by Christian compassion. Like Vanier, Kekes (The Examined Life) emphasizes the virtues, but his approach to the good life is pluralistic rather than Aristotelian. Arguing that no formalist doctrine such as Kant's can provide universally valid rules for leading a moral life, he instead maintains that the study of admirable individuals furnishes the guidelines we need. Among those Kekes finds worthy of emulation are Montaigne and Thomas More, who balanced public responsibilities with private commitments. Kekes offers a close analysis of their conduct, thereby hoping to convey a sense of how choosing a personal ideal is influenced by general moral constraints. Bell suggests a more personal way of addressing life's meaning, discussing incidents in his own life that may help others find an answer to this question. In particular, he stresses his need to subordinate personal ambition to the Civil Rights Movement. His principled stand involved him in several crucial conflicts, one of which led to his resignation from the faculty of Harvard Law School. (He is now a visiting professor at NYU.) Bell also presents insights on his friendship with women and on religion, again from a personal perspective. These three books are highly recommended for all public libraries.<br><i>David Gordon, Bowling Green State Univ., OH </i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Claudius the God</h2><p>Robert Graves begins anew the tumultuous life of the Roman who became emporer in spite of himself.

Hilarious and heartbreaking, this is a scathing, ironic tale whose fictional couple parallels the real-life relationship of Fitzgerald and his wife, from its romantic beginnings to its tragic end. It remains to this day a devastating portrait of insatiable greed, ruthless ambition, and wasted talent.</p><p>This edition includes a detailed account of the composition of the novel, a textual apparatus, a chronology of composition, and, uniquely, three versions of the ending. Explanatory notes situate The Beautiful and Damned in its times and deepen the reader&#39;s understanding of Fitzgerald&#39;s sources for the novel.Following the great critical and financial success of his first novel, <i>This Side of Paradise,</i> F. Scott Fitzgerald published <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i> in 1922. An immediate success upon its first publication, Fitzgerald's second novel is a dazzling portrait of love and life among the beautiful people. Through the story of two newlyweds, Anthony Patch of New York and Gloria Gilbert of Kansas City, Fitzgerald flawlessly captures the heady atmosphere and jaded values of the Jazz Age. Patch, expecting to become the sole heir to his grandfather's millions, embraces a life of endless parties and intellectual pretensions. In Gloria, he finds an exquisite ornament and a passionate lover. The couple whirls through days that mirror Fitzgerald's own--a fast life amid a smart set for which there is never enough cash. Beginning with wit and clever repartee, <i>The Beautiful and the Damned</i> quickly becomes a scathing chronicle of a dying marriage and a hedonistic society where beauty is all too fleeting. Through the character of Richard Caramel, a successful hack writer whose talent fails as he prospers, Fitzgerald caricatures himself. But today's readers will find an even more poignant self-portrait of Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda in Anthony and Gloria, a couple whose days of wine and roses fade quickly toward a tragic end.</p><h2>Lord of the World</h2><p>From right to left of the huge interior, across the platforms, swelling every instant, surged an enormous swaying, roaring crowd. The flight of steps, twenty yards broad, used only in cases of emergency, resembled a gigantic black cataract nearly two hundred feet in height. Each car as it drew up discharged more and more men and women, who ran like ants towards the assembly of their fellows. The noise was indescribable.</p><p><p>Can a timeless book become timely 100 years after its first appearance?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In this profound and prescient novel, Monsignor Robert Hugh Benson gives us an imaginative foretelling of the end of the world. All stories, Aristotle said, have a beginning, a middle, and an end, but most ends are relative, the terminus of this chain of acts or that. But what of the end that terminates all human action as we know it, the end of time itself, the Second Coming? Since this novel appeared in 1906, many others have been devoted to nuclear disaster, destructive comets, and other hair-raising possibilities. What sets Benson&#x2019;s story apart and makes it as readable today as when it was written is the Catholic and biblical context that provides the ultimate meaning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Hugh Benson (1871&#x2013;1914) was the son of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and his conversion to Catholicism caused a stir. He became a great apologist for the faith, in spiritual works as well as in works of the imagination. Lord of the World is first of all a tremendous &#x201c;read,&#x201d; but it is also spiritual food for thought.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The late Ralph McInerny contributed a fine preface to the work, and recently Fr. C. John McCloskey III, a specialist on the work of Robert Hugh Benson, added a fascinating introduction.<br>&nbsp;</p>LORD OF THE WORLD is a bitingly satiric science fiction novel of a secularized world state. As Rosa Mulholland, Lady Gilbert, declared, "It is a brilliant, beautiful, and terrible book," a judgment in which the public has fully concurred for nearly a century. LORD OF THE WORLD is the only one of Benson&#x2019;s novels to remain continually in print from its first publication in 1907 down to the present day. Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen declared, "The three great apocalyptic pieces of literature dealing with the advent of the satanic are Father Hugh Benson&#x2019;s LORD OF THE WORLD, Dostoyevsky&#x2019;s THE BROTHERS KARAMOZOV, and Soloviev&#x2019;s THREE CONVERSATIONS ON WAR."</p><h2>O4685 - Singing - The Mechanism and the Technic</h2><p>This mechanistic book is an attempt to compile under one cover objective findings from various reliable sources and to relate them to the art of singing.

Of <i>Harvest,</i> Michael Palmer declared: "Only a riveting storyteller who is also a physician could have written this book." Now, Gerritsen again weaves frighteningly realistic medical detail into heart-stopping suspense, as a small-town doctor races to unravel the roots of a violent epidemic -- before it destroys everything she loves. <p> Lapped by he gentle waters of Locust Lake, the small resort town of Tranquility, Maine, seems like the perfect spot for Dr. Claire Elliot to shelter her adolescent son, Noah, from the distractions of the big city, and the lingering memory of his father's death. She's also hopeful that she can earn the trust of the town as she builds a new practice. But all her plans unravel with the news of a shocking incident: a teenage boy under her care has committed an appalling act of violence. </p><p> Claire has stopped prescribing a controversial drug to the troubled boy, a decision that some in town now second-guess. But before she can defend herself, a rash of new teenage violence erupts in Tranquility, forcing Claire to perform increasingly risky emergency procedures. And when one of her patients dies, the town's panic turns to fury. </p><p> Shaken by accusations, and fearful that Noah is now at risk, Claire desperately searches for a medical cause behind the murderous epidemic. She begins to suspect that the placid waters of Locust lake conceal a disturbing history -- and an insidiously lethal danger. But while Claire races to save the town -- and her son -- from harm, she discovers an even greater threat: a shocking conspiracy to manipulate nature, and turn innocents to slaughter. </p><p> Woven with the kind of action and detail only a doctor could deliver, and propelled by an expert sense of small-town terror, <i>Bloodstream</i> is Tess Gerritsen's most unforgettable thriller yet.</p></p><p>Tess Gerritsen left a successful practice as an internist to raise her children and concentrate on her writing. She gained nationwide acclaim for her first novel of medical suspense, <i>Harvest,</i> which became a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, and for her second national bestseller, <i>Life Support,</i> both of which are available in paperback from Pocket Books. She lives in Maine.<b>Chapter 1: The Present</b><br><br>"Someone's going to get hurt out there," said Dr. Claire Elliot, looking out her kitchen window. Morning mist, thick as smoke, hung over the lake, and the trees beyond her window drifted in and out of focus. Another gunshot rang out, closer this time. Since first light, she'd heard the gunfire, and would probably hear it all day until dusk, because it was the first day of November. The start of hunting season. Somewhere in those woods, a man with a rifle was tramping around half-blind through the mist as imagined shadows of white-tailed deer danced around him.<br><br>"I don't think you should wait outside for the bus," said Claire. "I'll drive you to school."<br><br>Noah, hunched at the breakfast table, said nothing. He scooped up another spoonful of Cheerios and slurped it down. Fourteen years old, and her son still ate like a two-year-old, milk splashing on the table, crumbs of toast littering the floor around his chair. He ate without looking at her, as though to meet her gaze was to come face to face with Medusa. And what difference would it make if he did look at me, she thought wryly. My darling son has already turned to stone.<br><br>She said again, "I'll drive you to school, Noah."<br><br>"That's okay. I'm taking the bus." He stood up and grabbed his backpack and skateboard.<br><br>"Those hunters out there can't possibly see what they're shooting at. At least wear the orange hat. So they won't think you're a deer."<br><br>"But it looks so dorky."<br><br>"You can take it off on the bus. Just put it on now." She took the knit cap from the mitten shelf and held it out to him.<br><br>He looked at it, then finally, at her. He had sprouted up several inches in just one year, and they were now the same height, their gazes meeting straight on, neither one able to claim the advantage. She wondered if Noah was as acutely aware of their new physical equality as she was. Once she could hug him and a child would hug back. Now the child was gone, his softness resculpted into muscle, his face narrowed to a sharp new angularity.<br><br>"Please," she said, still holding out the cap.<br><br>At last he sighed and jammed the cap over his dark hair. She had to suppress a smile; he did look dorky.<br><br>He had already started down the hallway when she called out: "Good-bye kiss?"<br><br>With a look of exasperation, he turned to give her the barest peck on the cheek, and then he was out of the door.<br><br>No hugs anymore, she thought ruefully as she stood at the window and watched him trudge toward the road. It's all grunts and shrugs and awkward silences.<br><br>He stopped beneath the maple tree at the end of the driveway, pulled off the cap, and stood with his hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched against the cold. No jacket, just a thin gray sweatshirt against a thirty-seven-degree morning. It was cool to be cold. She had to resist the urge to run outside and bundle him into a coat.<br><br>Claire waited until the school bus appeared. She watched her son climb aboard without a backward glance, saw his silhouette move down the aisle and take a seat beside another student -- a girl. Who is that girl? she wondered. I don't know the names of my son's friends anymore. I've shrunk to just a small corner of his universe. She knew this was supposed to happen, the pulling away, the child's struggle for independence, but she was not prepared for it. The transformation had occurred suddenly, as though a sweet boy had walked out of the house one day, and a stranger had walked back in. <i>You're all I have left of Peter. I'm not ready to lose you as well.</i><br><br>The bus rumbled away.<br><br>Claire returned to the kitchen and sat down to her cup of lukewarm coffee. The house felt hollow and silent, a home still in mourning. She sighed and unrolled the weekly <i>Tranquility Gazette.</i> HEALTHY DEER HERD PROMISES BOUNTIFUL HARVEST, announced the front page. The hunt was on. Thirty days to bag your deer.<br><br>Outside, another gunshot echoed in the woods.<br><br>She turned the page to the police blotter. There was no mention yet of last night's Halloween disturbance, or of the seven rowdy teenagers who'd been arrested for taking their annual trick-or-treating too far. But there, buried among the reports of lost dogs and stolen firewood, was her name, under VIOLATIONS: "Claire Elliot, age forty, operating vehicle with expired safety sticker." She still hadn't brought the Subaru in for its safety inspection; today she'd have to drive the truck instead, just to avoid getting another citation. Irritably she flipped to the next page and was scanning the day's weather forecast -- cold and windy, high in the thirties, low in the twenties -- when the telephone rang.<br><br>She rose to answer it. "Hello?"<br><br>"Dr. Elliot? This is Rachel Sorkin out on Toddy Point Road. I've got something of an emergency out here. Elwyn just shot himself."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"You know, that idiot Elwyn Clyde. He came trespassing on my property, chasing after some poor deer. Killed it too -- a beautiful doe, right in my front yard. These stupid men and their stupid guns."<br><br>"What about Elwyn?"<br><br>"Oh, he tripped and shot his own foot. Serves him right."<br><br>"He should go straight to the hospital."<br><br>"Well you see, that's the problem. He doesn't want to go to the hospital, and he won't let me call an ambulance. He wants me to drive him and the deer home. Well, I'm not going to. So what should I do with him?"<br><br>"How badly is he bleeding?"<br><br>She heard Rachel call out: "Hey, Elwyn? <i>Elwyn!</i> Are you bleeding?" Then Rachel came back on the line. "He says he's fine. He just wants a ride home. But I'm not taking him, and I'm certainly not taking the deer."<br><br>Claire sighed. "I guess I can drive over and take a look. You're on Toddy Point Road?"<br><br>"About a mile past the Boulders. My name's on the mail box."<br><br>The mist was starting to lift as Claire turned her pickup truck onto Toddy Point Road. Through stands of white pine, she caught glimpses of Locust Lake, the fog rising like steam. Already beams of sunlight were breaking through, splashing gold onto the rippling water. Across the lake, just visible through fingers of mist, was the north shore with its summer cottages, most of them boarded up for the season, their wealthy owners gone home to Boston or New York. On the south shore, where Claire now drove, were the more modest homes, some of them little more than two-room shacks tucked in among the trees.<br><br>She drove past the Boulders, an outcropping of granite stones where the local teenagers gathered to swim in the summertime, and spotted the mailbox with the name <i>Sorkin.</i><br><br>A bumpy dirt road brought her to the house. It was a strange and whimsical structure, rooms added haphazardly, corners jutting out in unexpected places. Rising above it all, like the tip of a crystal breaking through the roof, was a glassed-in belfry. An eccentric woman would have an eccentric house, and Rachel Sorkin was one of Tranquility's odd birds, a striking, black-haired woman who strode once a week into town, swathed in a purple hooded cape. This looked like a house in which a caped woman might reside.<br><br>By the front steps, next to a neatly tended herb garden, lay the dead deer.<br><br>Claire climbed out of her truck. At once two dogs bounded out of the woods and barred her way, barking and growling. Guarding the kill, she realized.<br><br>Rachel came out of the house and yelled at the dogs: "Get out of here, you bloody animals! Go home!" She grabbed a broom from the porch and came tearing down the steps, long black hair flying, the broom thrust forward like a lance.<br><br>The dogs backed away.<br><br>"Ha! Cowards," said Rachel, lunging at them with the broom. They retreated toward the woods.<br><br>"Hey, you leave my dogs alone!" shouted Elwyn Clyde, who had limped out onto the porch. Elwyn was a prime example of an evolutionary dead end: a fifty-year-old lump bundled in flannel, and doomed to eternal bachelorhood. "They're not hurtin' nothin'. They're just watchin' after my deer."<br><br>"Elwyn, I got news for you. You killed this poor creature on my property. So she's mine."<br><br>"What you gonna do with a deer? Blasted vegetarian!"<br><br>Claire cut in: "How's the foot, Elwyn?"<br><br>He looked it Claire and blinked, as though surprised to see her. "I tripped," he said. "No big deal."<br><br>"A bullet wound is always a big deal. May I take a look at it?"<br><br>"Can't pay you..." He paused, one scraggly eyebrow lifting as a sly thought occurred. "'Less you want some venison."<br><br>"I just want to make sure you're not bleeding to death. We can settle up some other time. Can I look at your foot?"<br><br>"If you really want to," he said, and limped back into the house.<br><br>"This should be a treat," said Rachel.<br><br>It was warm inside the kitchen. Rachel threw a birch log into the wood stove, and sweet smoke puffed out as she dropped the cast iron lid back in place.<br><br>"Let's see the foot," said Claire.<br><br>Elwyn hobbled over to a chair, leaving smears of blood on the floor. He had his sock on, and there was it jagged hole at the top, near the big toe, as though a rat had chewed through the wool. "Hardly bothering me," he said. "Not worth all this fuss, if you ask me."<br><br>Claire knelt clown and peeled off the sock. It came away slowly, the wool matted to his foot not by blood but by sweat and dead skin.<br><br>"Oh God," said Rachel, cupping her hand over her nose. "Don't you ever change your socks, Elwyn?"<br><br>The bullet had passed through the fleshy web between the first and second toe. Claire found the exit wound underneath the foot. There was only a little blood oozing out now. Trying not to gag on the smell, she tested movement of all the toes, and determined that no nerves had been damaged.<br><br>"You'll have to clean it and change the bandages every day," she said. "And you need a tetanus shot, Elwyn."<br><br>"Oh, I got one of them already."<br><br>"When?"<br><br>"Last year, from ol' Doc Pomeroy After I shot myself."<br><br>"Is this an annual event?"<br><br>"That one went through my other foot. 'Tweren't a big deal."<br><br>Dr. Pomeroy had died back in January, and Claire had acquired all his old medical records when she'd bought the practice from his estate eight months ago. She could check Elwyn's file and confirm the date of his last tetanus shot.<br><br>"I guess it's up to me to clean that foot," said Rachel.<br><br>Claire took out a small bottle of Betadine from her medical bag and handed it to her. "Add that to a warm bucket of water. Let him soak in it for a while."<br><br>"Oh, I can do that myself," said Elwyn, and got up.<br><br>"Then we might as well just amputate right now!" snapped Rachel. "Sit <i>down,</i> Elwyn."<br><br>"Gee," he said, and sat down.<br><br>Claire left a few packets of bandages and gauze wrappings on the table. "Elwyn, you come into my office next week, so I can check the wound."<br><br>"But I got too much to do -- "<br><br>"If you don't come in, I'll have to hunt you down like a dog."<br><br>He blinked at her in surprise. "Yes, ma'am," he said meekly.<br><br>Suppressing a smile, Claire picked up her medical bag and walked out of the house.<br><br>The two dogs were in the front yard again, fighting over a filthy bone. As Claire came down the steps, they both spun around to stare at her.<br><br>The black one trotted forward and growled.<br><br>"Shoo," Claire said, but the dog refused to back down. It took another few steps forward, teeth bared.<br><br>The tan dog, spotting opportunity, snatched the bone in its teeth and began dragging away the prize. It got halfway across the yard before the black dog suddenly noticed the thief and streaked back into the fight. Yelping and growling, they thrashed around the yard in a tangle of black and tan. The bone lay, forgotten, beside Claire's pickup truck.<br><br>She opened the door and was just sliding in behind the steering wheel when the image registered in her brain. She looked down at the ground, at the bone.<br><br>It was less than a foot long, and stained a rusty brown with dirt. One end had broken off, leaving jagged splinters. The other end was intact, the bony landmarks recognizable.<br><br>It was a femur. And it was human.<br><br>Ten miles out of town, Tranquility Police Chief Lincoln Kelly finally caught up with his wife.<br><br>She was doing about fifty in a stolen Chevy, weaving left and right, the loose tailpipe kicking up sparks every time she hit a dip in the road.<br><br>"Man oh man," said Floyd Spear, sitting beside Lincoln in the cruiser. "Doreen got her snookerful today."<br><br>"I've been on the road all morning," said Lincoln. "Didn't get a chance to check up on her." He turned on the siren, hoping that would induce Doreen to slow down. She sped up.<br><br>"Now what?" asked Floyd. "Want me to call for backup?"<br><br>Backup meant Hank Dorr, the only other officer on patrol duty that morning.<br><br>"No," said Lincoln. "Let's see if we can't talk her into pulling over."<br><br>"At sixty miles an hour?"<br><br>"Get on the bullhorn."<br><br>0 Floyd picked up the mike and his voice boomed out over the speaker: "Hey, Doreen, pull over! C'mon, Sweetheart, you're gonna hurt someone!"<br><br>The Chevy just kept dipping and weaving.<br><br>"We could wait till she runs out of gas," Floyd suggested.<br><br>"Keep talking to her."<br><br>Floyd tried the mike again. "Doreen, Lincoln's here! C'mon, Sweetheart, pull over! He wants ta 'pologize!<br><br>"I want to <i>what?"</i><br><br>"Pull over, Doreen, and he'll tell you himself!"<br><br>"What in hell are you talking about?" said Lincoln.<br><br>"Women always expect a man to apologize."<br><br>"But I didn't do anything!"<br><br>Up ahead, the Chevy's brake lights suddenly lit up.<br><br>"See?" said Floyd as the Chevy rolled to a stop at the side of the road.<br><br>Lincoln pulled up behind it and climbed out of the cruiser.<br><br>Doreen sat hunched behind the steering wheel, her red hair wild and tangled, her hands shaking. Lincoln opened the door, reached over his wife's lap, and removed the car keys. "Doreen," he said wearily, "you gotta come back to the station."<br><br>"When are you coming home, Lincoln?" she asked.<br><br>"We'll talk about that later. Come on, Honey, let's get in the cruiser." He reached for her elbow but she shook him off and slapped his hand for good measure.<br><br>"I just want to know when you're coming home," she said.<br><br>"We've talked about this and talked about this."<br><br>"You're still married to me. You're still my husband."<br><br>"And there's just no point in talking about it any more." Again he took her elbow. He already had her out of the Chevy when she hauled off and slugged him in the jaw. He staggered back a few steps, his whole head ringing.<br><br>"Hey!" said Floyd, grabbing Doreen's arms. "Hey now, you don't wanna go doing that!"<br><br>"Lemme go!" screeched Doreen. She broke out of Floyd's grasp and took another swing at her husband.<br><br>This time Lincoln ducked, which only made his wife madder. She got in one more swing before Lincoln and Floyd managed to get her arms secured.<br><br>"I hate to do this," said Lincoln. "But you're just not being reasonable today." He snapped the handcuffs on her wrists. She spat at him. He wiped his sleeve across his face, then patiently guided his wife into the backseat of the cruiser.<br><br>"Oh man," said Floyd. "You know we're gonna have to book her."<br><br>"I know." Lincoln sighed and slid in behind the wheel.<br><br>"You can't divorce me, Lincoln Kelly!" said Doreen. "You promised to love and cherish!"<br><br>"I didn't know about the bottle," said Lincoln, and he turned the car around.<br><br>They drove at a leisurely speed toward town, Doreen cussing a purple streak the whole time. It was the drinking that did...</p><h2>Niki De Saint Phalle: Insider-Outsider--World Inspired Art</h2><p>70 color and black and white photographs and bibliographical and selected solo and group exhibitions lists. Commentaries by Martha Longenecker, Niki de Saint Phalle, Janice Parente, Pontus Hulten and Mario Botta. Design and editing by Martha Longenecker, Director. ISBN No, 0-919155-10-5. <p>The fantastic imagery and monumental figures of this internationally-known self-taught artist--sculptures, paintings, reliefs graphic works and maquettes.</p></p><p>Excerpt from the book <p>Introduction by Martha Longenecker </p><p>In the passage of our lives we are, indeed, fortunate who feel our spirits quicken by the seeing of visual works of art -- tangible expressions of innate creative powers wanting and bursting to be expressed by all human beings. </p><p>Mingei International is a young museum dedicated to furthering understanding of art of people from all cultures of our world. These objects integrally related to life speak eloquently of the similarities and distinctions of individuals and cultures. At this auspicious time of its twentieth anniversary, the Museum has chosen to present the arresting work of a French-American who perhaps has had the greatest international impact of any woman artist of the twentieth century. </p><p>Playful, fresh, frolicsome, vigorous, soaring, creative, different, colorful, uninhibited, innovative, energizing, spontaneous, imaginative, delightful, benevolent, stimulating, powerful -- all of these adjectives have been used in an attempt to describe what cannot be put into words, the buoyant and vast spirit expressed in the art of Niki de Saint Phalle. </p><p>Her drawing, painting and sculpture stimulate connections with all of life, and many reflect archetypal images to which we are all related at the deepest level. Familiar forms such as chairs, tables, lamps and vases are transformed into spirited images often provocative and amusing. They help us to see the familiar in a fresh and approachable new way. </p><p>Hollow architectural forms invite one to enter, explore and touch wondrous surfaces. One of Niki's works most loved by children is the large skull in which they play, moving in and around, looking in and out as they enjoy a new dimension. Fear of death may be replaced by their intuiting the transitory life of the body and the inhabiting spirit beyond. Adults, too, find delight in sitting on the laps of Charlie and Claire, other larger-than-life figurative works. </p><p>Born in France of French heritage, Niki was raised and educated in the United States of America before returning as an adult to her homeland where her career as an artist developed. Hers is a French/American spirit of universal roots -- the same boundless source of all art throughout time, interest in which has been so powerfully reawakened in the twentieth century. </p><p>Niki's work is the epitome of a long, arduous and successful struggle of ever-deepening perception and unfragmented action of body, mind and spirit. It has matured through many years of working in collaboration with many other artists and craftsmen, including dancers, set designers, stone cutters, masons and welders. Because she has had no formal art training Niki's work is sometimes referred to as "outsider art," a kind of primitive or naive folk art. Paradoxically, it is precisely because she works intuitively, from the inside out, that the public has so enthusiastically embraced her art. Amazingly appealing to all manner of people globally, major installations include the Tarot Garden in Italy, the Stravinsky Fountain in Paris, a Niki Museum in Nasu, Japan, and work in progress, the Noah's Ark in Jerusalem. With her having received such broad recognition, many now consider her an insider. </p><p>Insider, outsider, whatever one may call it, the art of Niki de Saint Phalle is not to be ignored. It is life-changing. She has paved the way for the rich diversity of the 21st century and the end of superficial distinctions, including insider, outsider, folk, craft and fine art. Art is one with kinds as many as there are individuals. The international language of art knows no barriers of time, place, or race. It speaks directly to each of us personally according to our receptivity and changing perception...</p></p><h2>Kissing Christmas Goodbye (Agatha Raisin Mysteries, No. 18)</h2><p><p><i>Kissing Christmas Goodbye </i>continues the tradition in M.

To have the perfect Christmas had been a childhood dream whilst surviving a rough upbringing in a Birmingham slum.

Who in this rather sterile house, complete with fake family portraits, could have hated the old lady enough to poison her?<br> Agatha sets out to find the murderer, all the while managing a pretty, teenage trainee who makes her feel old and planning for a picture-perfect Christmas, with James, all the trimmings, and perhaps even snow.</p></p><p><p><b>Be careful what you wish for</b></p><p>Agatha Raisin is bored.

Whenever Jonathan James finds himself in a new situation, he hears his Whatif Monster asking all kind of questions to stop him trying something new: What if it&#39;s scary? What if they laugh? Finally, Jonathan James has some questions of his own: What if they don&#39;t? What then? Paperback Picture Book. Age 3 and up. Rated 5 Stars!</p><p>PreS-K-This picture book about a child who conquers his fears barely manages to avoid didacticism. The voice of the Whatif Monster, a small green creature with pointed teeth, fills Jonathan James's head with worry and doubt when he tries something new. "What if it's hard?/What if you're bad?/What if they laugh and/make you feel sad?" The rhyming text scans well at the beginning, but falters and sometimes feels forced as the story comes to a conclusion. Jonathan James questions the Whatif Monster: "And what if baseball is nothing but fun,/and I end up hitting a triple home run?" The bold, color illustrations are flat, and the faces of the children are lifeless. The ending, in which the boy finds a best friend after taking a chance, is satisfying and the lesson is a good one, but the book is too lacking in style and consistent charm to recommend.-Maralita L.

Not only is the book re-written, re-organized, updated and expanded, it contains over 125 more pages than the original. Ross provides a more explicit rendering of The Human Magnet Syndrome, that includes new theories, explanations and concepts. The information on Gaslighting and The Narcissistic Abuse Syndrome, like the rest of the book, is cutting edge and completely original. This book contains many more case examples and stories of Ross&#x2019;s own codependency recovery. Like its predecessor, it is written for both the layman and professional. Men and women have been magnetically and irresistibly drawn together into romantic relationships, not so much by what they see, feel and think, but more by invisible forces. Codependents and Pathological Narcissists are enveloped in a seductive dreamlike state; however, it will later unfold into a painful &#x201c;seesaw&#x201d; of love, pain, hope and disappointment. The soul mate of the codependent&#x2019;s dreams will become the narcissist of their nightmares. Readers of the Human Magnet Syndrome will better understand why they, despite their dreams for true love, find themselves hopelessly and painfully in love with partners who hurt them. This book will guide and inspire both the layman and the professional.</p><p>This book represents the culmination of the lastfiveyears of thinking about and making discoveries about the HumanMagnet Syndrome topics. While this book holds substantial value forhelping both professionals and the general reader, it will appeal mostto those who want to know more about the Human Magnet Syndrome and howit might impact their life. It is a universal phenomenon transcendingculture, ethnicity, political persuasion, language, and many other realand artificial dividing distinctions. For this reason, I couldn't beprouder that it has been translated into Spanish, French,and soon,Czech.<br><br>This book will help you understand and accept the painfultruth about why you have remained loyal to people who profess their love for you, but who, at the same time, hurt you--over and over again. Itwill guide you and hopefully help you recognize why you keep fallingprey to the same empty promises that never come to fruition, and whyyour own happily ever after is nothing more than a revolving,disappointing delusion. You will also be compelled to admit theunthinkable: you are as much a victim of, as you are at fault for, yourdysfunctional relationships.<br><br>Since knowledge is power and reading this will teach you what you need to know, expect to feel inspired andexcited. This book will become an indispensable resource as you begin to learn why you keep falling in love with someone who, in the beginning,seems virtually perfect and, in an instant, becomes your lover, bestfriend, and confidant--your soulmate. It will equally help youunderstand why these soulmates eventually take off their masks to reveal their harmful, and sometimes malignant and narcissistic, true selves.Ross Rosenberg, M.Ed., LCPC, CADC, CSAT is a psychotherapist,international speaker, author, professional trainer and expert witness.

Joe Gunther encounters a missing prime suspect, the murder of the suspect&#39;s girlfriend, environmental terrorism, drug dealing, and conspiracy.</p><p>Archer Mayor lives in Newfane, Vermont.<p>Baker Street is just a block beyond one of Brattleboro&#x2019;s more beaten paths &#x2014; an overlooked extension west of an otherwise busy four-way intersection. The other three streets either lead downtown or to shortcuts to the south side. But Baker falls off a slight embankment, part of a closed loop bordering a large empty field near the Whetstone Brook &#x2014; out of sight and largely out of mind.</p> <p>The buildings along it run from decrepit to slightly better, in varying stages. The address Don Matthews had given me was a two-story apartment building, once a home, now cut into four small, dark sections, each one neglected, stagnant, but cheap. The windows were all covered with familiar brittle and tattered plastic wrap, once put up to help stop the freezing air from whistling through the gaps, but left to age through all four seasons, year after year, until its only remaining effectiveness was to proclaim the hopelessness of those barely sheltered behind it.</p> <p>Willy and I had decided on a quiet approach, parking up the street and coming around the corner on foot. The weather was good &#x2014; clear, sharp, and cold enough to make your nose hairs tingle &#x2014; and I didn&#x2019;t mind the chance, however oddly presented, to be outside and away from the stifling indoor heat most people found comforting during the winter.</p> <p>We walked down the middle of the street. There was no traffic, and the sidewalks had been left to reemerge in the spring, typical of most of the town&#x2019;s less stringently tidy neighborhoods.</p> <p>&#x201c;Anything we should know about Jorja Duval?&#x201d; I asked Willy as the house loomed nearer.</p> <p>&#x201c;Nothing you couldn&#x2019;t guess,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;On welfare, on drugs, small history of dealing, tricking, and petty theft. Featured in a few domestics, according to Bratt PD, always as the punching bag. I knew her father back in the old days. Always figured he was banging her, although no charges were ever brought. He&#x2019;s at St. Albans now on a manslaughter charge. Jorja had a brother, too, but he OD&#x2019;d about five years ago.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How old is she?&#x201d;</p> <p>Willy hesitated. &#x201c;Twenty-five? Maybe younger.&#x201d;</p> <p>We drew abreast of the house, took it in quickly with a practiced eye, and then struggled our way up a pathway that had been cleared in the Walter Skottick fashion &#x2014; not at all.</p> <p>The peeling front door sported four rusty mailboxes by its side, none of them labeled. There were also no doorbells. I raised an inquiring eye at Willy.</p> <p>He pointed to the window above us and to the right. &#x201c;That one,&#x201d; He said softly, and twisted the doorknob.</p> <p>The door swung back to reveal a gloomy, barefloored hallway with a set of stairs heading up. The odorous fog that crept out to envelope us was rancid and flavored with mildew and a smell of humanity reminiscent of an overripe diaper pail. Neither one of us reacted, since as working environments went, this was pretty standard fare.</p> <p>We both paused for a moment, watching and listening, taking nothing for granted, knowing full well that inhabitants of such places were capable of anything.</p> <p>Hearing nothing, we headed upstairs. There was an extra stillness to the cold air I didn&#x2019;t like, though, and I could sense Willy felt the same way. He unbuttoned his coat, and removed his gun from its holster.</p> <p>Walking on the balls of our feet to partially muffle our shoes and the squeaking of old floor boards, we moved to either side of Jorja Duval&#x2019;s apartment door and paused once again, listening to nothing but our own breathing.</p> <p>I finally reached out and rapped on the door, looking up and down the hallway as I did so for any movement from the other two apartments on the landing. &#x201c;Jorja Duval? This is the police. Open up.&#x201d;</p> <p>The response was immediate, otherworldly, and psychologically chilling. From inside, we heard a single, high-pitched animal howl, followed by a series of thuds, crashes, and the sound of claws scrabbling across bare wood at high speed. It was as if my knock had unleashed some demonic pin ball that was now smacking off every wall and obstacle inside the apartment.</p> <p>&#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d; I muttered, and grasped the door knob, twisting it slowly.</p> <p>The door opened and a tabby cat flew out and froze for a split second at the sight of us, its hair on end, before shooting off like a rocket down the stairs. But not before I&#x2019;d seen that all four of its paws were crusty with dried blood.</p> <p>&#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; Willy burst out, his hand tight on the gun.</p> <p>Still recovering from the surprise, I chanced a fast glance around the corner, my own gun out as well. Pulling my head back, I described what I&#x2019;d seen to Willy. &#x201c;Short hall, two closed doors opposite each other. Big room beyond. All I could see there were two legs sticking into the middle of a big blood stain, and red paw prints all over the place.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We call for backup?&#x201d; he asked.</p> <p>I paused, thinking of the eerie stillness I&#x2019;d noticed earlier. &#x201c;No time. Ready on three?&#x201d;</p> <p>I held up three fingers, one at a time, and the two of us entered the small hallway as one, covering both the distant room and the two closed doors.</p> <p>The precautions proved unnecessary. The place was empty except for the dead woman in the middle of the floor, lying face up, spread-eagle, with her throat cut wide. The room was dingy, dark, barely furnished, splotched with blood, and seemed far less comfortable than the average coffin.</p> <p>&#x201c;This Jorja Duval?&#x201d; I asked Willy.</p> <p>He holstered his weapon. &#x201c;Was.&#x201d;</p> (Archer Mayor)</p><h2>Harley Quinn at Super Hero High (DC Super Hero Girls)</h2><p><b>Harley Quinn investigates a high-tech carnival in this action-packed new DC Super Hero Girl novel!</b><br><br>Funny girl Harley Quinn loves fighting crime with her classmates like Wonder Woman, Batgirl, and Supergirl, but she always does it her with own madcap style--and a big mallet!

The lingering effects of the Kesh and Malone prisons are gut-wrenchingly convincing. Less developed are the magical elements. Former prisoner Liam's ignorance of his fae side makes sense, as his mother, Kathleen, and mentor, Father Murray, seek to protect him, but Leicht only introduces one full-fledged fae, Liam's father, and his offstage war with the Redcap is more told than shown. Liam's marriage to Mary Kate is a believable complex of love, lust, pride, anger and forgiveness, but the really pivotal relationship is with Father Murray, a member of an arm of the church that kills the fae in the belief that they are Fallen. Perhaps later books will expand the intriguing premise. (Feb.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Ogilvie brings together a team of skilled and exceptional communicators to blend sound scholarship with life-related illustrations.</p><p>The design for the Preacher's Commentary gives the reader an overall outline of each book of the Bible. Following the introduction, which reveals the author's approach and salient background on the book, each chapter of the commentary provides the Scripture to be exposited. The New King James Bible has been chosen for the Preacher's Commentary because it combines with integrity the beauty of language, underlying Hebrew and Greek textual basis, and thought-flow of the 1611 King James Version, while replacing obsolete verb forms and other archaisms with their everyday contemporary counterparts for greater readability. Reverence for God is preserved in the capitalization of all pronouns referring to the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. Readers who are more comfortable with another translation can readily find the parallel passage by means of the chapter and verse reference at the end of each passage being exposited. The paragraphs of exposition combine fresh insights to the Scripture, application, rich illustrative material, and innovative ways of utilizing the vibrant truth for his or her own life and for the challenge of communicating it with vigor and vitality.</p></p><p><b>Paul Cedar</b> serves as the chairman/CEO of the Mission America Coalition, a partnership of hundreds of Christian leaders, denominations, ministries, and local churches collaborating to pray for every man, woman, young person, and child in America and appropriately share the gospel of Jesus Christ with them.

Professional killers with the souls of artists, would-be theater directors turned Kremlin puppet-masters, suicidal supermodels, Hell&#39;s Angels who hallucinate themselves as holy warriors, and oligarch revolutionaries: welcome to the glittering, surreal heart of twenty-first-century Russia. It is a world erupting with new money and new power, changing so fast it breaks all sense of reality, home to a form of dictatorship-far subtler than twentieth-century strains-that is rapidly rising to challenge the West. When British producer Peter Pomerantsev plunges into the booming Russian TV industry, he gains access to every nook and corrupt cranny of the country. He is brought to smoky rooms for meetings with propaganda gurus running the nerve-center of the Russian media machine, and visits Siberian mafia-towns and the salons of the international super-rich in London and the US. As the Putin regime becomes more aggressive, Pomerantsev finds himself drawn further into the system. Dazzling yet piercingly insightful, Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible is an unforgettable voyage into a country spinning from decadence into madness.</p><p>Peter Pomeranzev&#39;s writing has been praised as the most incisive about Russia.

The resulting effort is a double treat, for Crafty Chameleon is a pleasure to both the ear and the eye. Hadithi is a gifted storyteller, bringing together a lyrical use of language and a fine sense of cadence in the tradition of the world's greatest folk tales; his story of how the cunning chameleon outwits two bullies of the African bush, Leopard and Crocodile, calls to mind the wondrous talents of Kipling and Aardema. What Hadithi does with words, Kennaway does with visual images. Her watercolors evoke the natural palette of the bush and are at once both bold and subtle. She captures perfectly the humiliation, anger, and inventiveness of Chameleon while portraying Leopard and Crocodile as haughty, swaggering, and eventually defeated brutes. Crafty Chameleon is that rare and joyous balance of story and picture that so enriches children's literature.

The all-new scrapbook pages are full of fun facts and a letter from the author on how Arthur began. Photos from Marc Brown&#39;s personal archives reveal how the characters and events from the Arthur books are based on the author&#39;s family, friends, and experiences. This is one Arthur Adventure readers won&#39;t want to miss!</p><p>After 25 years of Arthur adventures, enthusiastic readers still agree with the conclusion of the very first book about this Everychild aardvark: "There's a lot more to Arthur than his nose." This 25th anniversary edition includes, in addition to the original story, <i>Arthur's Nose</i>, a scrapbook of fun facts, photos, and letters all about the evolution of Arthur over the years. Readers can compare photos of author Marc Brown's family with pictures of Arthur and his family. (Note the spooky similarity between Brown's sister, Bonnie, and Arthur's sister, D.W.--Brown doesn't deny it!). In a letter to his fans, Brown describes how Arthur came to be, and how he has developed over the years. A special illustrated section demonstrates just how much this friendly fellow's nose has changed, from a long, droopy, aardvarky nose in 1976, gradually shortening over the years to his nearly nonexistent schnoz today. Arthur has also acquired glasses and a much sunnier disposition over the last quarter century.<p> In <i>Arthur's Nose</i>, first grader Arthur decides that he doesn't like his nose. He goes to the rhinologist to change it, but ultimately decides, to the relief of his friends and family, "I'm just not me without my nose!" Luckily for readers today, Arthur is still Arthur, even without the original elongated proboscis. Fans of <i>Arthur's First Kiss</i>, <i>Arthur Accused!</i>, <i>Arthur and the Crunch Cereal Contest</i>, and the many other Arthur titles, will be thrilled to get a peek behind the scenes in this very special edition.

Over the course of his professional life, Osler gave many addresses&#x2014;mostly to medical students&#x2014;on medical ethics, medicine and the humanities, the relationship between the medical practitioner and the patient, and, as the titular essay makes clear, on the &#x201c;way of life&#x201d; he advocated for the ethical physician. He remains an inspiration to many contemporary medical practitioners; there are active Osler Societies throughout the world. <b><br></b> While Osler&#x2019;s talks were frequently published during his lifetime and they have been published individually and in different compilations since his death, none contain the over 1500 annotations that appear here, notes that serve to explain the many philosophical, biblical, historical, and literary allusions contained in Osler&#x2019;s writings. <br> This thoroughly explicated selection of Sir William Osler&#x2019;s writings will be cherished by physicians, medical students, nurses, philosophers, theologians, and ethicists in this&#x2014;and future&#x2014;generations.<br></p><p>&#x201c;This book enables our society and those to come to benefit from the wisdom of one of the greatest physicians of all time, Sir William Olser. For over a century Osler has been recognized as a force for the humanities and ethics in medicine and for patient-centered medicine, areas severely challenged today by the so-called managed care movement, health insurance, and governmental influences. It is a message not only for the medical profession but for all who would seek compassionate physicians who had been influenced and stimulated by Osler&#x2019;s timeless wisdom and humanity.

That evening, I described how a thirty-nine-year-old acquaintance of mine had suddenly died from a heart attack, leaving behind a beautiful wife, four energetic kids, and a thriving ministry. "I had been asked to speak to this father and husband about getting on God's health plan, but we never connected in time," I said that evening. "How would his life--and those who mattered most to him--had changed if he had managed to turn around his health in time?"</p> <p>A year later, my church asked me to speak again, and this time Joey introduced himself after the service. "When you spoke a year ago, that story about that thirty-nine-year-old guy really did a number on me. You see, I'm also a husband and a father, and I felt like you were speaking directly to me. I knew I had to do something."</p> <p>"Tell me about it," I said, intrigued, but humbled by what I had heard.<br> After he finished describing the events of the past year, I asked Joey if we could share his story with readers of the Great Physician's Prescription for Diabetes. Here's what happened in his words:</p> <p><em>Throughout much of 2003, I began feeling horrible. This was something new for me because I thought I was in good shape, even for a guy who had turned fifty. I had played football in college--I lined up as an offensive lineman at Mars Hill College in North Carolina--so I was encouraged to "eat big" when I was growing up. It was hard to get away from that mentality after my college days were over, however. Over the years, I gained some weight--probably a good twenty or thirty pounds extra on my six-foot, two-inch frame. When I tipped the scales at 250 pounds a few years ago, I told myself to do something about it. I attended so many Weight Watchers meetings that I received a lifetime membership, but once I went off their food, the weight always came right back.</em></p> <p>I think it's because I liked to eat Southern foods too much. My weakness was fried chicken, black-eyed peas, and collard greens with the ham bone cooked in, or country-fried steaks dripping with gravy and yellow rice. Dessert had to be a rich chocolate cake or pecan pie. </p> <p>Cheeseburgers and fries worked just fine for lunch. I worked as the transportation director at King's Academy, a private Christian school near my hometown of Royal Palm Beach, Florida, and a couple of times a week I borrowed the school's golf cart and drove to the Wendy's or Burger King located next door to school. People looked at me funny when they saw me ordering lunch from my golf cart, but I didn't mind. I was having fun.</p> <p>What wasn't fun was the shortness of breath and lack of energy that I began experiencing after turning fifty. Our house has a good-sized lawn that normally takes me several hours to mow. In the muggy Florida summer heat, I was too pooped to tackle the project. I'd lie down on the sofa, gasping for air and frightened by how fast my heart was beating. I felt really bad.</p> <p>Donna, my wife, was naturally concerned, and I was bothered that I didn't have the energy to keep up with our youngest son, a ten-year-old. Then one Sunday night in August 2003, I was sitting in church, listening to the pastor, when beads of sweat formed on my forehead. My heart thumped like a bass drum, and I feared that a heart attack was imminent. "Lord, what should I do?" I prayed. Things got so scary that I thought about signaling for an usher to call 911, but I didn't want to create a scene in the middle of a church service.</p> <p>I thought I was having high blood pressure problems since hypertension ran in the family. My symptoms calmed down a bit, so I toughed it out. I knew I should see a doctor, but I decided to wait a week or two for my annual physical. After my doctor poked and prodded around, he ordered tests on my blood and urine.</p> <p>I'll never forget the phone call from the doctor's office informing me that I had type 2 diabetes.</p> <p>Diabetes? That sounded serious. "Wait a minute," I said to the nurse. "I had my physical in the afternoon, so I'm not sure if I fasted for my blood work. I want to get this checked again."</p> <p>A repeat visit confirmed the test results. "I'm going to write you a prescription," my doctor said, handing me a slip and sending me on my way.</p> <p> My prescription was for thirty milligrams of Actos daily to treat type 2 diabetes. As the months passed, however, I can't say that I was feeling better or that the medication helped me regain my energy. My concerns were raised by newspaper stories that Actos could cause liver damage.</p> <p>Then I heard Jordan Rubin speak about the Great Physician's prescription for good health, and his message inspired me to make huge lifestyle changes in what I ate and how I lived. I asked Donna if we could buy our groceries at the health food store and purchase some of the whole food nutritional supplements that Jordan recommended. I think she fell over in shock because she had been encouraging me for years to live a healthier lifestyle.</p> <p>I began eating a healthy diet filled with fruits, vegetables, and the right type of dairy, eggs, and meats. The days of passing through the Wendy's drive-lane in a golf court were long gone. Energy returned to the point where I could mow my big lawn again and keep up with the kids. After a few weeks, I felt so good that I stopped taking my diabetes medication. Within a year, I had lost forty pounds and got down to my old high school playing weight.</p> <p>When my annual physical came around in August 2004, I visited a new physician, but I did not disclose that I had been told a year earlier that I had diabetes. I wanted him to treat me with no preconceptions. So you can imagine my surprise when the tests results from the lab confirmed that my cholesterol was good, my blood pressure was normal, and everything else was fine, meaning I didn't have diabetes.</p> <p>Wow! Jordan Rubin was right. He said that if I followed the Great Physician's prescription, there would be a good chance that I'd reverse the damage I'd done to my body, and that's exactly what happened.</p> <p><strong>The Latest Epidemic</strong></p> <p>Meeting people like Joey Hinson and hearing their stories is awesome, but my ears always perk up when someone says they have diabetes. You see, I had my own battle with diabetes back when I was a nineteen-year-old student at Florida State University a little more than a decade ago.</p> <p>I chronicled my health odyssey in <em>The Great Physician's Rx for Health and Wellness</em>, where I described how my 185-pound body was attacked by Crohn's disease--a debilitating digestive disorder--along with a grab bag of other ailments: arthritis, chronic fatigue, hair loss, amebic dysentery, chronic candidiasis, prostate and bladder infections, as well as diabetes. Within a year, I wasted away to 104 pounds and feared an early death. </p> <p>Because I was fighting battles on so many medical fronts, I wasn't your typical diabetes patient, but I've never forgotten how both of my lower legs turned purple from extremely poor circulation. Now that got my attention. Although my doctors never suggested that I was a candidate for amputation, the thought of losing a leg crossed my young mind. If my health degenerated to a point where amputation was necessary, I really thought I would be better off dying.</p> <p>Fortunately, and with great gratitude to my Lord and Savior, my health gradually improved, and the circulation in my legs returned to normal. Ever since I got well, I've carried a healthy respect for how diabetes impacts people's lives, and that impact is expected to double worldwide in the next twenty-five years. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh in Britain are projecting a global rise in diabetes from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030. The greatest relative increases will occur in the Middle Eastern Crescent, sub-Saharan Africa, and India, matching a similar rise in obesity rates.</p> <p> Here in the United States, the alarm has already been sounded regarding diabetes. According to the most recent government statistics, around 18 million Americans--or 6.3 percent of the population--have been diagnosed with diabetes, and researchers estimate that there may be almost as many undiagnosed diabetics. The disease displays a strong ethnic bias based on its prevalence, in terms of percentage, among Native Americans, African-Americans, and Hispanics, as well as the aged. </p> <p>Diabetes kills more than 200,000 Americans every year, ranking it as the sixth-leading cause of death. Health authorities, however, believe that diabetes is underreported as a cause of death because many families and doctors, for one reason or another, choose not to enter the disease on the death certificate. A probable reason is that people often die of complications relating to diabetes--heart disease, strokes, high blood pressure, and kidney disease--so that disease becomes recorded as the cause of death.</p> <p>Thus, many people are unaware that they even have diabetes. Although the affliction trails cancer and heart disease by considerable margins in the cause-of-death department, medical practitioners are calling diabetes a runaway epidemic because an estimated 41 million Americans have pre-diabetes, according to government estimates. Pre-diabetes is the period when people at high risk for developing full-blown diabetes demonstrate signs of intermittent elevated blood sugar levels. While their bodies are still capable of processing glucose--the energy that fuels the body's cells--their blood sugar levels are spiking like an aggressive teen driver running up the RPMs on his tachometer.</p> <p>The "redline" image is apropos, especially since the American Diabetes Association has come out with red plastic wristbands as a way of creating awareness for the disease, just as cyclist Lance Armstrong introduced the canary yellow "Live Strong" wristbands as a fundraiser for cancer r...</p></p><h2>Searching For John Ford: A Life</h2><p>Hollywood has given us no greater director than John Ford. Between 1917 and 1970, Ford directed and/or produced some 226 pictures, from short silent films to ambitious historical epics and searingly vivid combat documentaries. His major works-- such as <i>Stagecoach</i>, <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, <i>How Green Was My Valley</i>, <i>They Were Expendable</i>, <i>The Quiet Man</i>, <i>The Searchers</i>, and<i> The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</i>-- are cinematic classics. Ford's films about American history are profound explorations of the national character and the crucibles in which that character was forged. Throughout his long and prolific career, Ford became best known for redefining the Western genre, setting his dramas about pioneer life against the timeless backdrop of Monument Valley.<br><br>Ford's films earned him worldwide admiration. As a man, however he was tormented and deliberately enigmatic. He concealed his true personality from the public, presenting himself as an illiterate hack rather than as the sensitive artist his films show him to be. He shrewdly guided the careers of some of Hollywood's greatest stars, including John Wayne, Henry Fonda, James Stewart, Maureen O'Hara, and Katharine Hepburn, but he could be abusive, even sadistic, in his treatment of actors. He began his life steeped in the lore of Irish independence and progressive politics; by the end a hawkish Republican and rear admiral in the U.S. Navy, he was lionized by Richard Nixon for creating films that extol the "old virtues" of heroism, duty, and patriotism. Little wonder that those who have written about Ford have either strained to reconcile the daunting paradoxes of his work and personality or avoided them entirely. They have printed the legend and ignored the facts-- or printed the facts and obscured the legend.<br><br>In its depth, originality, and insight, <i>Searching for John Ford</i> surpasses all previous biographies of the filmmaker. Encompassing and illuminating Ford's complexities and contradictions, Joseph McBride comes as close as anyone ever will to solving what Andrew Sarris called the "John Ford movie mystery." McBride traces the whole trajectory of Ford's life, from his beginning as "Bull" Feeney, the near-sighted, football-playing son of Irish immigrants in Portland, Maine, through to his establishment as America's most formidable and protean filmmaker. The author of critically acclaimed biographies of Frank Capra and Steven Spielberg, McBride interviewed Ford in 1970 and co-wrote the seminal study <i>John Ford</i> with Michael Wilmington. For more than thirty years, McBride has been exploring the interconnections between Ford's inner life and his work. He interviewed more than 120 of the director's friends, relatives, collaborators, and colleagues. Blending lively and penetrating analyses of Ford's films with an impeccably documented narrative of the historical and psychological contexts in which those films were created, McBride has at long last given John Ford the biography his stature demands.<i> Searching for John Ford</i> will stand as the definitive portrait of an American genius.<br></p><p><b>Joseph McBride</b> is a film historian and critic whose fourteen books include <i>Orson Welles</i>, <i>Hawks on Hawks</i>, <i>Steven Spielberg: A Biography</i>, and <i>Frank Capra: The Catastrophe of Success</i>. A former reporter and reviewer for <i>Daily Variety</i> in Hollywood, he is an adjunct professor of film and literature in the Irish studies program at New College of California in San Francisco.<br>"My name's John Ford. I make Westerns." Ford preferred to let his work speak for itself, and his abrasive encounters with film scholars have become legendary. In fact, "Pappy" Ford, who fancied himself a journeyman director, would probably have been perplexed by these two recent additions to the rapidly growing library of Ford film criticism. Arriving hard on the heels of Scott Eyman's comprehensive Print the Legend: The Life and Times of John Ford (LJ 10/1/99), McBride's weighty tome, several decades in preparation, paints a similar portrait: Ford was an insecure alcoholic whose gruff, even sadistic treatment of family, friends, cast, and crew masked his sensitive, sentimental nature. Complex and contradictory like many of his films Ford was a man who stood up to McCarthyite blacklisters but later churned out crude propaganda in support of the Vietnam war. He celebrated tradition, family, and community but was a miserable failure as husband and father. As Eyman did, McBride (Frank Capra; Steven Spielberg) draws on exhaustive research and interviews, but he has the advantage of a few memorably brief meetings with the Great Man himself. Ford left an impressive if uneven body of work, and McBride does it justice, examining each film in illuminating detail. Still, although McBride's book is very deserving, public and academic libraries that cannot collect both biographies should stick to Eyman's more streamlined telling. Studlar (film and English, Univ. of Michigan) and Bernstein (film, Emory Univ.) take readers into academic territory, offering nine essays on the work plus a "dossier" of articles on the man and filmmaker. Robin Wood leads off with a classic critique, questioning whether Ford's late films measure up to his early work. Other essays discuss the role of women and religion in Ford's film universe, and the hotly disputed controversy about whether his last epic Cheyenne Autumn was a "mea culpa" for previous insensitive portrayals of the American Indian. Westerns is recommended for academic collections. Stephen F.

Prebble was an ancient, pipe-clanking fortress on the edge of campus with heating problems, leaky ceilings, and those 1930s wall radiators we used to melt crayons on in grade school. &#x201c;You pay fifty thousand dollars a year to attend this institution,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and they stick you in a&nbsp;<i>hovel&nbsp;</i>for four years. It&#x2019;s because they&nbsp;<i>hate&nbsp;</i>art.&#x201d;</p><p>The tuition comment didn&#x2019;t hold much weight for me. I was on scholarship. My peers talked about skiing in Aspen and summers in the Hamptons. Ballister was their safety school when Stanford and Duke eluded them. They spoke with the opaque, offhand world knowledge of the privileged. My first weekend there, I watched a girl at a party barf into a five-hundred-dollar Coach purse. Terrified of the cafeteria&#x2019;s clamor, I had taken to eating three meals of ramen noodles a day in my dorm room.</p><p>I went to Ballister because of the visual arts program, because they&#x2019;d given me their Poor Appalachian Kid scholarship, and because it was as far away from home as I could manage. I had chosen art because I needed something to make use of the bright lights that had existed in my head for as long as I could remember, my fervent, neon wish to be someone else. In high school, I sampled my way up and down the artistic spectrum methodically, like the good student I was, hoping I&#x2019;d land on something that sparked me: I sketched, I constructed shadowboxes, I threw some rudimentary pots, trying a little of everything, committing seriously to nothing. Too scared, at that point, to put myself at stake for fear of failure. The revelation, maybe, that I had nothing to give. I had yet to encounter anything that made the risk seem worthwhile. I came to Ballister hoping that being there would put an end to my floundering. That I would finally buckle down and find what I was supposed to make, and that it would&nbsp;<i>mean&nbsp;</i>something.</p><p>I had taken the Amtrak train twenty-two hours out of Maysville, Kentucky, to the tiny upstate New York town in which Ballister was located. Ballister was, I was surprised to learn, not too terribly removed from Canada. My parents&#x2019; geographic sense of the north wasn&#x2019;t much better than mine. They didn&#x2019;t believe me at first, when I told them I was five hours from New York City and hence out of harm&#x2019;s reach. Before I left, my father cleared his throat and thumped me on the back like I was another man. My mother gave me a fierce hug, something with a degree of pain to it, and said with her chin hooked over my shoulder, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you come back pregnant.&#x201d;</p><p>My parents met working in a factory that made lawnmower parts. The brand&#x2019;s claim to fame: George Jones had once drunkenly straddled its luxury model while pursued by the Texas State Police. They were resigned to their jobs, to each other, and to us, their children, who had all the fish sticks and Nintendo we needed. They watched&nbsp;<i>Wheel of Fortune </i>with three feet of space between them on the couch. They fought often, and loudly. Neither had gone to college; they hoped I would become something useful, like a CPA.</p><p>The closest I had come to finding something that lit me up was in a summer gifted-and-talented program, just before my senior year. In an art course there, I made a graphic novella of the night my mom threw an ottoman at my dad, laboring over how the glass patio door shattered, shards tumbling in an arc of beauty into the green holler bottom below. I painted a textured oil backdrop to simulate the night air wadding itself into a tornado: the Horror of &#x2019;89, which touched down that very night in regions of East Kentucky, West Virginia, and the golden triangle of Kingsport, Johnson City, and Bristol, Tennessee. The instructor, upon seeing it, complimented me but grimaced. Said, &#x201c;I like the little cartoons, but how about we fit your skills into a more serious framework?&#x201d; And pushed a pamphlet for architecture school at me.</p><p>McIntosh scared me as much as the rest of Ballister did. He was a serious artist, or had been at one point&#x2014;a sort of eighties gallery darling whose decline had acted as a chute into teaching, a profession for which he had no real passion. &#x201c;Oh yah, McIntosh is&nbsp;<i>intense,</i>&#x201d; said the senior VA major who&#x2019;d given me a tour at orientation. But McIntosh was more than just intense. He was a carnivore who loved to eviscerate freshmen, a real crinkle of joy seaming his mouth as he did. We were instructed to bring a sketch to the first class for discussion, and McIntosh made a blonde with perfect posture, daughter of a D.C. diplomat, tear up when he put her sketch of a woman striding down a crosswalk on the projector. &#x201c;I want you to pay attention here,&#x201d; he told us. &#x201c;This is a case in point as to the importance of exactness in your line work, and the price paid when you become sloppy.&#x201d; He took his laser pointer, made circles around the figure&#x2019;s smudged face. &#x201c;What a&nbsp;<i>deeply confusing&nbsp;</i>expression. This woman looks&nbsp;<i>constipated.&nbsp;</i>Was that your intention, Margaret?&#x201d; He put his laser pointer down as she began to sniffle. &#x201c;Well, don&#x2019;t feel discouraged. This is&nbsp;<i>Ballister.&nbsp;</i>There&#x2019;s always room for one more prelaw student.&#x201d; I felt lucky when he glanced at my sketch&#x2014;an old lady who&#x2019;d ridden the train with me until Charlottesville, Virginia, asleep with an opened bag of Planters in her hand&#x2014;wrinkled his nose, and said only, &#x201c;In bad need of discipline.&#x201d;</p><p>During the third class, McIntosh put another one of my assignments up on the projector. It was a sketch I&#x2019;d done of a dog chained to a stake in a yard. I didn&#x2019;t realize it until it was on the wall, but the yard appeared to be on the side of a mountain. It took me the distance from my chair to the screen to realize it: I had drawn Kentucky. I looked at what I&#x2019;d done, glowing large in front of the class, and felt homesickness wrapping itself around my throat, my eyes growing hot until McIntosh said, &#x201c;Good. Some rather inspired pencil work here, and here.&#x201d;</p><p>It would be the only nice thing he would say about me all semester. I was shocked out of crying. Everyone turned, subtly, to look.</p><p>The only person I&#x2019;d spoken to on campus for more than fifteen minutes was a boy from Kansas named Zack. Zack was also a VA major and was obsessed with M. C. Escher. Accordingly, I was in love with him. I incorporated his form into the bright lights of what I supposed my future would be, staking all my hopes on him. My drug of choice at eighteen: the quiet devouring of boys in my head. In the secret back pages of my sketchbook, I had even drawn him.</p><p>Zack was also in McIntosh&#x2019;s class. My eyes automatically drifted to the left, where he sat at a neighboring table. If I hadn&#x2019;t looked in that direction, I might not have seen Mel.</p><p>She was perched at a high table with her upper body craned over the desk, wiry arms and legs folded like a praying mantis, looking at me through frayed blond bangs. One dirty Chuck Taylor pressed the floor, bouncing nervously. She looked sleep-deprived&#x2014;rumpled clothes, an evident ink stain on the knee of her jeans, little lines around her eyes the rest of us didn&#x2019;t have yet. This was the girl over whom McIntosh went into raptures the first couple of classes&#x2014;she was, apparently, his sole exception to inhaling freshmen. Session one, she brought in a sketch of a man on a front porch, raising what looked like a mug in the shape of a cowboy boot to his lips, and there was this&nbsp;<i>look&nbsp;</i>the man was giving, so salty you could almost eat it. Funny and sly and even, in the cocked eyebrow, a little angry that someone thought they could spy on him like that. &#x201c;Ex<i>press</i>ion,&#x201d; McIntosh trilled, rocking on his heels. And we could see it, too, even if we didn&#x2019;t know how to say it&#x2014;it was excellent. Steady, confident lines, delicate shading. It was work that had a good enough idea of itself to be playful.</p><p>Her second sketch was a color-smeared cluster of kids in torn T-shirts, safety pins, snarls, all collectively clobbering the hell out of each other. Punks, genuine enough to make me lean away in awe. The look was harsh yet soft, dreamy and glazed, curves creamy. The group fought as a cloud of dust, the result of their scuffling, rose above their shoes. &#x201c;A little overboard with the blending,&#x201d; McIntosh said, &#x201c;but the&nbsp;<i>look&nbsp;</i>of it is really something. And there&#x2019;s a degree of fun here, too, yes? Some daring? Who were these people, Ms. Vaught?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just some kids I hung around with this summer.&#x201d; She had a funny voice, deep with the puncture of broken glass. It made me look up for a second before I went back to my sketchbook.</p><p>In my first weeks at Ballister, I kept my ambition secret. I wanted so badly to be more than what I felt. I wanted to be<i> good.&nbsp;</i>I wanted to be great, even. But I was cowed by the knowledge that everyone else here did, too&#x2014;people who&#x2019;d come from bigger places and better schools than I had, people who&#x2019;d traveled and had training and experiences and seemed, in a strange way, more like&nbsp;<i>people&nbsp;</i>out in the&nbsp;<i>world&nbsp;</i>than I&#x2019;d ever been or, I feared, ever would be. Seeing their work&#x2014;good, bad, comparable to mine&#x2014;only ever made me think of what&nbsp;<i>I&nbsp;</i>could do, if I could do it better, and not with a sense of confidence or competitiveness, but fear.</p><p>When I looked at Mel&#x2019;s stuff, I felt something different. I didn&#x2019;t know how to quantify what I was seeing in words, but I could feel it. She was naturally, easily good, and when I saw things she had done, I felt a curiously pleasurable pressure at my middle. It was an expansive, generous feeling. Before I saw her, even, I saw what she did.</p><p>Class ended. I watched Zack pick up his backpack and head out the door in the direction of the dorms, and saw one of the girls in class who did work I called, in my head,&nbsp;<i>Hallmark crap</i>&#x2014;beatific faces, brave seascapes&#x2014;catch up to him, blond hair bouncing against her coat.</p><p>Then I heard that broken-glass voice next to me. &#x201c;Nice work up there today.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I turned. Mel was pulling a denim jacket over her skinny shoulders. She smiled, ticked her head back in recognition.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;I like seeing McIntosh clam up,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Like, when some- thing floors him and he doesn&#x2019;t have any Sorbonne stories in response and he&#x2019;s forced to just shut the fuck up. Doesn&#x2019;t that give you joy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do like it better when he&#x2019;s not talking.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a cluster growing behind us&#x2014;Margaret, the diplo- mat&#x2019;s daughter, a boy named Edward whose mother was some sort of photography bigwig at&nbsp;<i>Vogue,&nbsp;</i>and a girl from Mexico named Reva whose family was rumored to run a drug cartel and who was wearing a bracelet studded with what I assumed were real diamonds. Just a few in the parade of intimidation that was Ballister. They&#x2019;d all been pulled in by Mel; were surreptitiously following her, in fact.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re gonna try this bar downtown,&#x201d; Mel said. &#x201c;Wanna come?&#x201d; My sister had given me a gift before I left Kentucky. She&#x2019;d never had much use for me&#x2014;for most of our lives, the fact that we were related was her chief shame&#x2014;but when I accepted the scholarship and we both knew I would soon leave for a place she&#x2019;d never been, she began to look at me with new, slightly awed regard. The night before my train was scheduled to leave, she tossed me a little square wrapped in paper and said, &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s your going-away present.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a fake ID, a very poor one, but in the days before holograms and magnetic strips, it was laminated and had the Kentucky Commonwealth logo on it, so it would do fine. The brunette in the picture looked nothing like me and was named&nbsp;<i>Nicole Cockrell</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see your fakie,&#x201d; Mel said on the way to the bar. She leaned over, pushing her horn-rims to the top of her head. I was struck by the way she smelled&#x2014;like men&#x2019;s deodorant, low-grade and spicy. She pulled her fake out, we compared&#x2014;she was&nbsp;<i>Jocelyn Stone</i>&#x2014;and she went, &#x201c;Heh&nbsp;<i>heh</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>It was mostly me Mel talked to that night. The rest of the art kids eventually left, but we stayed, huddled at the bar with Miller High Lifes. &#x201c;They can&#x2019;t hold their liquor yet,&#x201d; Mel said, wagging her hand at the door. &#x201c;Kiddies.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t tell her that I could count on one hand the number of times I&#x2019;d gotten drunk.</p><p>I saw the corner of a brightly colored book sticking from her bag.&nbsp;<i>Deadbone Erotica.&nbsp;</i>On the cover, wonky neon lizards cavorted with large-breasted Amazonian women.</p><p>I plucked it out, looked it over. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d;</p><p>Mel raked her hand through her pageboy. It was the longest I would ever see her hair. Two weeks later, she would hit it with cerulean Manic Panic and walk around Smurf-headed until Christmas. Then she shaved it all off and bitched about the northern winter teabagging her scalp.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s fuckin rad is what that is.&#x201d; She leaned over and tapped the&nbsp;<i>Deadbone&nbsp;</i>cover. &#x201c;You&nbsp;<i>like&nbsp;</i>comics.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t a question.</p><p>I flipped through. It was drawn in a bubble style: weird, druggy shapes. I had just started paying attention to method, color, how things were rendered, the technical shit they wake you up to in school that you can&#x2019;t help but see everywhere after. The comic was alive, bright and blasted. But there was something else drawing me in&#x2014;the yellowed paper, the deep, musty smell. It was like cutting down a tree and counting the rings within. A creepy awareness of the years passing.</p><p>&#x201c;I bet you&#x2019;re more of a Warner Brothers fan, though.&#x201d; Mel tilted her beer at me. &#x201c;I can tell. From your stuff. You do that thing, too, where there&#x2019;s this, like, acknowledgment that&nbsp;<i>crazy&nbsp;</i>exists. Like it&#x2019;s out there and pretty close by, actually, but you don&#x2019;t have to draw it for us. We get the hint.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I used to watch some Looney Tunes,&#x201d; I said slowly, trying to gauge whether I was about to say something of friendship-disqualifying weirdness.</p><p>&#x201c;Right on.&#x201d;</p><p>What I didn&#x2019;t tell her: I actually spent&nbsp;<i>every&nbsp;</i>Saturday morning watching Looney Tunes, then the uncensored, wartime Merrie Melodies marathons that aired on weekend afternoon cable. Nazi smashers, vintage high-speed chases through Technicolor deserts. I could still remember how offended, how personally&nbsp;<i>smote,&nbsp;</i>I was when Nickelodeon first censored those cartoons: blurring or blocking the oversized pistols, the entire screen fuzzing at the shot that made Daffy Duck&#x2019;s feathers fly. I was already a purist. A devotee, of some sort.</p><p>The dust clouds in Mel&#x2019;s picture. Those were WB takeoff clouds, to be sure. Funny and a little bit eerie at the same time. I knew I&#x2019;d seen them somewhere before.</p><p>But saying this would have felt like speaking volumes. It was more effort than I could expend, for how afraid I was of chasing Mel off. So all I said was &#x201c;Yeah, they were awesome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So do you draw comics?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I used to. And then I went to this summer arts program.

A writer for <i>The New Yorker</i> and <i>The</i> <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, Carl Elliott ventures into the uncharted dark side of medicine, shining a light on the series of social and legislative changes that have sacrificed old-style doctoring to the values of consumer capitalism. Along the way, he introduces us to the often shifty characters who work the production line in Big Pharma: from the professional guinea pigs who test-pilot new drugs and the ghostwriters who pen &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; articles for drug manufacturers to the PR specialists who manufacture &#x201c;news&#x201d; bulletins. We meet the drug reps who will do practically anything to make quota in an ever-expanding arms race of pharmaceutical gift-giving; the &#x201c;thought leaders&#x201d; who travel the world to enlighten the medical community about the wonders of the latest release; even, finally, the ethicists who oversee all that commercialized medicine has to offer from their pharma-funded perches.<br> &nbsp;<br> Taking the pulse of the medical community today, Elliott discovers the culture of deception that has become so institutionalized many people do not even see it as a problem. Head-turning stories and a rogue&#x2019;s gallery of colorful characters become his springboard for exploring larger ethical issues surrounding money. Are there certain things that should not be bought and sold? In what ways do the ethics of business clash with the ethics of medical care? And what is wrong with medical consumerism anyway? Elliott asks all these questions and more as he examines the underbelly of medicine.</p><p><b>Carl Elliott</b> is a professor at the Center for Bioethics at the University of Minnesota. His work has appeared in <i>The</i> <i>New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly,</i> <i>The Believer,</i> and on Slate.com. He is the author or editor of six previous books, including <i>Better Than Well, Prozac as a Way of Life,</i> <i>The Last Physician,</i> and <i>A Philosophical Disease</i>. Elliott lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota.<b>Chapter One</b><br><i>The Guinea Pigs</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> On September 11, 2001, James Rockwell was camped out in a clinical-research unit on the eleventh floor of a Philadelphia hospital where he had enrolled as a subject in a high-paying drug study. As a rule, studies that involve invasive medical procedures are more lucrative&#x2014;the more uncomfortable, the better the pay&#x2014;and in this study, subjects had a fiber-optic tube inserted in their mouths and down their esophaguses so that researchers could examine their gastrointestinal tracts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rockwell had enrolled in many previous studies at corporate sites, places like Wyeth and GlaxoSmithKline. But the atmosphere there felt professional, bureaucratic, and cold. This unit was in a university hospital, not a corporate lab, and the staff had a casual attitude toward regulations and procedures. &#x201c;The Animal House of research units&#x201d; is what Rockwell calls it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m standing in the hallway juggling,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m up at five in the morning watching movies.&#x201d; Although study guidelines called for stringent dietary restrictions, the subjects got so hungry that one of them picked the lock on the food closet. &#x201c;We got giant boxes of cookies and ran into the lounge and put them in the couch,&#x201d; Rockwell says. &#x201c;This one guy was putting them in the ceiling tiles.&#x201d; Rockwell has little confidence in the data that the study produced. &#x201c;The most integral part of the study was the diet restriction,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;and we were just gorging ourselves at two a.m. on Cheez Doodles.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> On the morning of September 11, nearly a month into the five-week study, the subjects gathered around a television and watched the news of the terrorist attacks through a drug-induced haze. &#x201c;We were all high on Versed after getting endoscopies,&#x201d; Rockwell says. He and the other subjects began to wonder if they should go home. But a mass departure would have ruined the study. &#x201c;The doctors were like &#x2018;No, no!&#x2019; &#x201d; Rockwell recalls. &#x201c;&#x2018;No one&#x2019;s going home, everything&#x2019;s fine!&#x2019; &#x201d; Rockwell stayed until the end of the study and was paid seventy-five hundred dollars. He used the money to make a down payment on a house.<br> &nbsp;<br> Rockwell is a wiry thirty-year-old massage-therapy student with a pierced nose; he seems to bounce in his seat as he speaks, radiating enthusiasm. Over the years, he has enrolled in more than twenty studies for money, he estimates. The Philadelphia area offers plenty of opportunities for aspiring human subjects. It is home to four medical schools and is part of a drug-industry corridor that stretches from there into New Jersey. Bristol-Myers Squibb regularly sends a van to pick up volunteers at the Trenton train station.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today, fees as high as the one that Rockwell received in 2001 aren&#x2019;t unusual. The best-paying studies are longer, inpatient trials, where subjects are often required to check into a research facility for days or even weeks at a time so that their diets can be controlled, their blood and urine tested regularly, and their medical status carefully monitored. Occasionally, they also undergo invasive procedures, like bronchoscopies or biopsies, or suffer through something else unpleasant, such as being deprived of sleep, wearing a rectal probe, or having allergens sprayed in their faces. Because such studies require a fair amount of time in a research unit, the usual subjects are people who need money and have a lot of time to spare: the unemployed, college students, contract workers, ex-cons, or young people living on the margins who have decided that testing drugs is better than punching a clock with the wage slaves. In some cities, like Philadelphia and Austin, the drug-testing economy has produced a community of semiprofessional research subjects who enroll in one study after another. Some of them do nothing else. For them, guinea-pigging, as they call it, has become a job. Many of them say that they know people who have been traveling around the country doing studies for fifteen years or longer. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s crazy and it&#x2019;s sad,&#x201d; one drug-trial veteran told me. &#x201c;For me, this is not a life. But it is a life for a lot of these people.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> � � �<br> &nbsp;<br> Most drug studies used to take place in medical schools and teaching hospitals. Pharmaceutical companies developed the drugs, but they contracted with academic physicians to carry out the clinical testing. According to the <i>New England Journal of Medicine, </i>as recently as 1991, 80 percent of industry-sponsored trials were conducted in academic health centers. Academic health centers had a lot to offer pharmaceutical companies: researchers who could design the trials, publications in reputable journals that could help market the products, and a pool of potential subjects on whom the drugs could be tested. But in the past decade or so, the pharmaceutical industry has been testing more drugs, the trials have grown more complex, and the financial pressure to bring drugs to market swiftly has intensified. Impatient with the slow pace of academic bureaucracies, pharmaceutical companies have moved trials to the private sector, which is where more than 70 percent of them were conducted in 2004.<br> &nbsp;<br> This has spurred the growth of businesses that specialize in various parts of the commercial-research enterprise. The largest of the new businesses are called contract research organizations (CROs) and include Quintiles, Covance, Parexel, and PPD (Pharmaceutical Product Development), a company that has operations in thirty countries, including India, Israel, and South Africa. These firms are hired to shepherd a product through every aspect of its development, from subject recruitment and testing through FDA approval. Speed is critical: a patent lasts twenty years, and a drug company&#x2019;s aim is to get the drug on the shelves as early in the life of the patent as possible. In 2000, when the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services asked one researcher what sponsors were looking for, he replied, &#x201c;Number one&#x2014;rapid enrollment. Number two&#x2014;rapid enrollment. Number three&#x2014;rapid enrollment.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The result has been a broadening of the range of subjects who are used and an increase in the rates of pay they receive.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most professional guinea pigs are involved in Phase I clinical trials, in which the safety of a potential drug is tested, typically by giving it to healthy subjects and studying any side effects that it produces. (Phase II trials aim to determine dosing requirements and demonstrate therapeutic efficacy; Phase III trials are on a larger scale and usually compare a new drug&#x2019;s results with those of standard treatments.) The better trial sites offer such amenities as video games, pool tables, and wireless Internet access. If all goes well, a guinea pig can get paid to spend a week watching <i>The Lord of the Rings </i>and playing Halo with his friends in exchange for wearing a hep-lock catheter in one arm and eating institutional food. Nathaniel Miller, a Philadelphia drug-trial veteran who started doing studies in order to fund his political activism, was once paid fifteen hundred dollars in exchange for three days and two endoscopies at Temple University, where he was given a private room with a television. &#x201c;It was like a hotel,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;except that twice they came in and stuck a tube down my nose.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The shift to the market has created a new dynamic. The relationship between testers and test subjects has become, more nakedly than ever, a business transaction. Guinea pigs are the first to admit this. &#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s doing this out of the goodness of their heart,&#x201d; Miller says. Unlike subjects in later-stage clinical trials, who are usually sick and might enroll in a study to gain access to a new drug, people in healthy-volunteer studies cannot expect any therapeutic benefit to balance the risks they take. As guinea pigs see it, their reason for taking the drugs is no different from that of the clinical investigators who administer them and who are compensated handsomely for their efforts. This raises an ethical question: what happens when both parties involved in a drug trial see the enterprise primarily as a way of making money?<br> &nbsp;<br> � � �<br> &nbsp;<br> In May of 2006, Miami-Dade County ordered the demolition of a former Holiday Inn, citing various fire and safety violations. It had been the largest drug-testing site in North America, with six hundred and seventyfive beds. The operation had closed down earlier that year, shortly after the financial magazine <i>Bloomberg Markets </i>reported that the building&#x2019;s owner, SFBC International, was paying undocumented immigrants to participate in drug trials under ethically dubious conditions.3 The medical director of the clinic had gotten her degree from a school in the Caribbean and was not licensed to practice. Some of the studies had been approved by a commercial ethical review board owned by the wife of an SFBC vice president. (The company, which has since changed its name to PharmaNet Development Group, says that it required subjects to provide proof of their legal status, and that the practice of medicine wasn&#x2019;t part of the medical director&#x2019;s duties. In August 2007 the company paid $28.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit.4)<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was a human-subjects bazaar,&#x201d; says Kenneth Goodman, a bioethicist at the University of Miami who visited the site. The motel was in a downtrodden neighborhood; according to later reports, paint was peeling from the walls, and there were seven or eight subjects in a room. Goodman says that the waiting area was filled with potential subjects, mainly African American and Hispanic; administrative staff members worked behind a window, like gas-station attendants, passing documents through a hole in the glass.<br> &nbsp;<br> The SFBC scandal was not the first of its kind. In 1996, the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>reported that at its testing site in Indianapolis, Eli Lilly and Company was using homeless alcoholics from a local shelter to test experimental drugs at budget rates. (Lilly&#x2019;s executive director of clinical pharmacology told the <i>Journal </i>that the homeless people were driven by &#x201c;altruism&#x201d; and that they enrolled in trials because they &#x201c;want to help society.&#x201d; The company says that it now requires subjects to provide proof of residence.) The Lilly clinic, the <i>Journal </i>reported, had developed such a reputation for admitting the down-and-out that subjects traveled to Indianapolis from all over the country to participate in studies.5<br> &nbsp;<br> How did the largest clinical-trial unit on the continent recruit undocumented immigrants to a dilapidated motel for ten years without anyone&#x2019;s noticing? Part of the answer has to do with our system of oversight. Before the 1970s, medical research was poorly regulated; many Phase I subjects were prisoners. Reforms were instituted after congressional investigations into abuses like the four-decade-long Tuskegee syphilis studies, in which researchers observed, instead of treating, syphilis infections in African American men. For the past three decades, institutional review boards, or IRBs, have been the primary mechanism for protecting subjects in drug trials. FDA regulations require that any study in support of a new drug be approved by an IRB. Until recently, IRBs were based in universities and teaching hospitals and were made up primarily of faculty members who volunteered to review the research studies being conducted in their own institutions. Now that most drug studies take place outside academic settings, research sponsors can submit their proposed studies to for-profit IRBs, which will review the ethics of a study in exchange for a fee. These boards are subject to the same financial pressures faced by virtually everyone in the business. They compete for clients by promising a fast review. And if one for-profit IRB concludes that a study is unethical, the sponsor can simply take it to another.6<br> &nbsp;<br> Moreover, because IRBs scrutinize studies on paper only, they are seldom in a position to comment on conditions at a study site. Most of the standards that SFBC violated in Miami, for example, would not be evaluated in an ordinary off-site ethics review. IRBs ask questions like &#x201c;Have the subjects been adequately informed of what the study involves?&#x201d; They do not generally ask if the sponsors are recruiting undocumented immigrants or if the study site poses a fire hazard. At some trial sites, guinea pigs are housed under conditions that would drive away anyone with better options. Guinea pigs told me about sites that skimp on meals and hot water or that require subjects to bring their own towels and blankets. A few sites have a reputation for recruiting subjects who are threatening or dangerous but who work cheap.<br> &nbsp;<br> Few people realize how little oversight the federal government provides for the protection of subjects in privately sponsored studies. The Office for Human Research Protections, in the Department of Health and Human Services, has jurisdiction only over research funded by the department. The FDA oversees drug safety, but, according to a 2007 HHS report, it conducts &#x201c;more inspections that verify clinical trial data than inspections that focus on human-subject protections.&#x201d; In 2005, FDA inspectors were finally given a code number for reporting &#x201c;failure to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects,&#x201d; and an agency spokesman says that they planned to make more human-subject-safety inspections in the future, but as of early 2008 they had cited only one investigator for a violation. (A psychiatrist had held a research subject in his Oklahoma research facility against her will for four days after she tried to drop out of a drug trial. The psychiatrist had also been disciplined by the state licensing board for giving herpes to two of his patients.) In any case, the FDA inspects only about 1 percent of clinical trials.<br> &nbsp;<br> The guinea-pig pro has a delicate relationship with trial recruiters. Technically speaking, recruiters are supposed to frown on the practice of serial guinea-pigging. It is not clear what sort of data is generated by trials on people who have recently been taking many other drugs. Nor is it clear what toll these experimental drugs are taking on the long-term health of the guinea pigs themselves. For these reasons, most sites require that guinea pigs wait at least a month after one trial has ended before enrolling in another one. In practice, however, that requirement is sometimes handled with a wink and a nod. If a guinea pig behaves in a study, he may find himself recruited for a new one before he even leaves the trial site.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet because their motivation for doing studies is purely financial, guinea pigs have a concrete incentive to lie about their medical history in order to qualify. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t lie then you&#x2019;re talking yourself out of a job,&#x201d; one guinea pig told me. Guinea pigs learn never to admit that they have been sick, that they have used illicit drugs, or that they have recently been in another study. However, once guinea pigs are accepted into a study, they are given financial incentives to stay in. Many sponsors penalize guinea pigs for missing follow-up appointments, and some back-load the pay scale so that guinea pigs have to stay in a study until the end in order to get most ...</p><h2>Glock Reference Guide</h2><p><p><strong>Your guide to the world of Glock!</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p>Gun Digest's&nbsp;<em>Glock Reference Guide</em>&nbsp;is the definitive resource for this amazing pistol.

Whether you're dreaming of being a professional, or just want to have fun singing and strumming, you can trade air guitar for a real one with this guide full of instruction and inspiration. The heart of the book: a playing section, divided into 20 self-contained lessons, each introducing new ideas and techniques. And, they cover a range of styles: rock, folk, country, jazz, blues, and classical. You'll start right at the beginning, with how to stand and sit properly while holding the instrument, and find out how to tune it, do fingerpicking, master timing and rhythm, and improvise. An extensive chord dictionary contains over 1,000 chord fingerings. <i>Bonus</i>: biographical portraits of the pioneer greats, like Les Paul, Jimi Hendrix, and Keith Richards, with details of their equipment and a discography of their key recordings.<br></p><p>It isn't often that a book with "total" in its title delivers, but this is one of the exceptions. Burrows is a prolific writer on all things guitar (e.g., K.I.S.S. Guide to Playing Guitar), and his latest covers everything. Part 1, on playing, contains 20 lessons, each introducing new ideas and techniques and fully illustrated with color photos. Chords, scales, timing, and rhythm are a few of the topic covered. In Part 2, there is a complete chord dictionary with notation and fingering charts. Part 3 discusses amplifying the guitar (whether acoustic or electric) and, finally, recording and performing. Sprinkled throughout the text are brief biographical portraits of great players with details of their equipment and a discography of their key recordings. This is an absolutely first-rate production, with glossy paper stock, full-color photos and illustrations throughout, and a quality binding. In all, a lot of book for the price; highly recommended for public libraries.<br><i>Eric C. Shoaf, Brown Univ.

Therefore, when the religion of a people is weakened, so also is its morality undermined. The result is a progressive collapse of law and order, and the breakdown of society. <br> <br> Men, though, see law as a limitation on their liberty, and Christianity is held to be the most restrictive with its emphasis upon Biblical law as the foundation for morality and liberty. Humanistic man wants total liberty, but he does not realize that total liberty leads only to total anarchy, and that leads to the death of law and liberty. Unless every man's liberty is limited by law, no liberty is possible for any one. <br> <br> In this concise volume, R. J. Rushdoony expounds on the central themes of the application of Biblical law to every area of life. This book is a great starting point to understanding Rushdoony's larger expositions on Biblical law.</p><p></p><h2>Bella and Stella Come Home</h2><p>After Bella says good-bye to her old house, it&#39;s time to meet her new one. But this house isn&#39;t anything like Bella expected. The entranceway has ten steps instead of three, the bathtub has feet, and worst of all, it does not feel like home. But Bella knows how to be brave, and with her imaginary best friend Stella by her side, it doesn&#39;t take long for her feelings about her new house to change-especially when she spies a next-door neighbor who looks like he&#39;d make a perfect new friend.</p><p>Christopher Denise lives in Providence, Rhode Island.PreS-Gr 2&#x2013;Bella, an endearing girl with a big imagination and lots of personality, is nervous about moving to a new home. Fortunately, her trusted stuffed elephant, Stella, who looms large and lifelike in the child's mind, remains at her side through the upcoming uncertainties. Everything at the new house is different. The kitchen is painted yellow and the bathtub has feet. Her mother says that the house has character, but Bella is not impressed with the empty, dusty rooms. The doubtful Bella and Stella venture upstairs to find their bedroom, which is empty except for one box in the middle of the floor. Once all of her belongings are moved in, Bella begins to relax, but at night her fears return and she has to sleep with the lights on. In the morning, the neighbors pop in for a visit and Bella makes a new friend, a bespectacled boy with a stuffed giraffe. At last, the new house begins to feel like home. The sweet narrative, told from Bella's point of view, perfectly captures the little girl's psyche. The story is enhanced by luminous, almost photographic illustrations drawn in shades of pink, ivory, and gold. With her expressive features and mop of dark curls, Bella stands out on each page. This delightful story would pair well with Scott Beck's Little House, Little Town (Abrams, 2004).&#x2013;Linda L. Walkins, Mount Saint Joseph Academy, Brighton, MA. (c) Copyright 2010.

This is a serious art book, a depiction of a tragic Britain with tragic taste, and a photographic entertainment which a large audience will enjoy.</p><p>As the title of this little book suggests, each of the postcards that fill its pages is, in a sense, quite boring. Stale, often dully composed images of corporate headquarters, roadways, bus-station parking lots, convalescent-home dayrooms, hospital cafeterias, and undistinguished motels. But look carefully, and the cards--culled from the collection of artist Martin Parr--are filled with fascinating little details. As a group, they offer readers the interesting opportunity to puzzle over the collective psyche of the people of the 1950s and '60s (the approximate vintage of the images) who were inclined to create, buy, and send these cards. What, one can't help but wonder, could be so scintillating about a room at the Fortes Excelsior Motor Lodge near Pontefract, Yorkshire? The singular force of the orange bedspreads, carpet, drapes, and walls punctuated by the inexplicably white leather upholstered panel attached to the wall unit behind each of the room's beds. The exterior of the Mirfield Modern School, shot at a distance and unimaginatively placed dead in the center of the gray sky and green playing field? The building's Bauhaus-like lines. The tarmac of Luton Airport in London? The pink jumbo jet being towed into the frame from the left. The uniformly shaped trailers parked at the Freshwater Caravan Camp? The handwritten X that presumably marks the sender's location. The Chalets at Llandanwg? Arguably, not much. The few hundred images here, unfettered by any explanatory text, offer a far from dull diversion for any readers interested in mid-century design or the mundane details of daily life. <i>--Jordana Moskowitz</i>The 160 postcards presented in this volume have been reproduced as found, in their original size, with all the character of the original reproduction, amateur retouching, crinkly edges and bent corners. Treated as art objects with a classic white border surround, each is captioned with their original descriptor as printed on the front or reverse - for example: A40 Traffic; Market Precinct, Scunthorpe; A bend on Porlock Hill. All the postcards featured depict scenes in the British Isles; most stem from a period of optimism in Britain as new civic centres, motorways, airports and power stations were built and launched. To qualify as &#34;boring&#34;, the photographs had to be arguably boring or absent of anything interesting. The postcards, finally, are not boring at all, but powerful, interesting and loaded statements about time and place and the aesthetic of Britain.</p><h2>Saigon</h2><p>Four families--American, French, and Vietnamese--find their destinies intertwined as they endure fifty years of political turmoil, revolution, and war, in a story that traces the fate of Saigon from 1925 to 1975</p><p>Anthony Grey became a foreign correspondent with Reuters after beginning his career in journalism in Norfolk, England, where he was born and educated. He reported on the Cold War from East Berlin, Prague, Warsaw, Budapest, Sofia, and Bucharest for two years before being assigned to China to cover the Cultural Revolution.

In powerful black-and-white comic strip images, Satrapi tells the story of her life in Tehran from ages six to fourteen, years that saw the overthrow of the Shah's regime, the triumph of the Islamic Revolution, and the devastating effects of war with Iraq. The intelligent and outspoken only child of committed Marxists and the great-granddaughter of one of Iran's last emperors, Marjane bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country. <br>Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life. Marjane's child's-eye view of dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, Persepolis is at once a story of growing up and a reminder of the human cost of war and political repression. It shows how we carry on, with laughter and tears, in the face of absurdity. And, finally, it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom we cannot help but fall in love.</p><p>&#x201c;Delectable. . .

Marjane Satrapi may have given us a new genre."<br>--Gloria Steinem<br><br>I grew up reading the Mexican comics of Gabriel Vargas, graduated to the political teachings of Rius, fell under the spell of Linda Barry, Art Spiegelman, and now I am a fan of Marjane Satrapi. Her stories thrummed in my heart for days. <b>Persepolis</b> is part history book, part Scheherazade, astonishing as only true stories can be. I learned much about the history of Iran, but more importantly, it gave me hope for humanity in these unkind times.<br>&#x2014;Sandra Cisneros, author of <b>The House on Mango Street<i> </i></b>and <b>Caramelo</b><br><br>I thought [<b>Persepolis</b>] was a superb piece of work, not only for the child's eye view&#x2014;the developing child's eye view&#x2014;of a society unknown to many of us in the west, and feared and suspected in proportion to being unknown.... Satrap has found a way of depicting human beings that is both simple and immediately comprehensible, AND is almost infinitely flexible. Anyone who's tried to draw a simplified version of a human face knows how immensely difficult it is not only to give the faces a range of expression, but also to maintain identities from one frame to the next. It's an enormous technical accomplishment."<br>--Philip Pullman, author of<b><i> </i>The Golden Compas</b>s, <b>The Subtle Knife</b>, and <b>The Amber Spyglass</b>.<br><i><br>"</i>I cannot praise enough Marjane Satrapi's moving account of growing up as a spirited young girl in revolutionary and war-time Iran. <b>Persepolis</b> is disarming and often humorous but ultimately it is shattering."<br>-- Joe Sacco, author of <b>Palestine</b> and <b>Safe Area Gorazde</b><i><br><br></i>This witty, moving and illuminating book demonstrates graphically why the future of Iran lies with neither the clerics nor the American Empire. <br>--Tariq Ali Author of <b>The Clash of Fundamentalisms: Crusades, Jihads and Modernity</b><i><br><br></i>"I found the work immensely moving with depths of nuance and wisdom that one might never expect to find in a comic book. It&#x2019;s a powerful, mysterious, enchanting story that manages to reflect a great swath of Iranian contemporary history within the sensitive, intimate tale of a young girl&#x2019;s coming-of-age. I didn&#x2019;t want it to end!"<br>&#x2014;Diana Abu-Jaber, Author of <b>Crescent</b> and <b>Arabian Jazz</b><i><br><br></i>"A rare and chilling memoir that offers every reader a personal, honest portrait of Iran's recent political and cultural history. Ms. Satrapi's provocative, graphic narrative of life in Iran before and after the Islamic revolution is an extraordinary testament to the level of human suffering experienced by Iranians tossed from one political hypocrisy to another. Aside from the humanistic dimension, the beautifully minimalist <b>Persepolis</b> gives further evidence of Marjane Satrapi's sensitivity and superb skill as an artist."<br>--Shirin Neshat, visual artist/filmmaker<br><br>"Readers who have always wanted to look beyond political headlines and CNN's cliches should plunge into this unique illustrated story.

But Marjane Satrapi has succeeded brilliantly.

But the issue of virtues and public life has been around much longer. In fact, in the late 1700s William Wilberforce, a renowned British statesman and counsel to Prime Minister William Pitt, penned what would become one of the most eloquent statements concerning Christian civil responsibility ever written. Its influence extended across the Atlantic and into the following centuries. Among his many contributions to society, Wilberforce is best known for his efforts on behalf of slaves throughout the world, and in a very real sense he laid the ground work for the abolition of slavery in the United States. This annotated critical reissue of the first edition of Wilberforce&#39;s most influential work pays tribute to his legacy and seeks to restore Wilberforce to his rightful place in the cultural memory of the community worldwide. Kevin Belmonte not only preserves for us the text of this literary and cultural gem but he also provides the sources behind Wilberforce&#39;s numerous quotations from Latin, literature, and Scripture. An introduction by Charles Colson mirrors the ongoing relevance of Wilberforce&#39;s notion of Christian social responsibility.<p><b>William Wilberforce</b> (1759-1833) was a member of the British Parliament. He was also affiliated with the Clapham Sect, a group of Evangelicals who were active in public life. He was very instrumental in many social justice issues, including the abolition of slavery in England.</p></p><h2>Philostratus: Lives of the Sophists.

When the American Declaration of Independence declared "all men are created equal" and the French proclaimed the Declaration of the Rights of Man during their revolution, they were bringing a new guarantee into the world. But why then? How did such a revelation come to pass? In this extraordinary work of cultural and intellectual history, Professor Lynn Hunt grounds the creation of human rights in the changes that authors brought to literature, the rejection of torture as a means of finding out truth, and the spread of empathy. Hunt traces the amazing rise of rights, their momentous eclipse in the nineteenth century, and their culmination as a principle with the United Nations's proclamation in 1948. She finishes this work for our time with a diagnosis of the state of human rights today.</p><p><b>Lynn Hunt</b>, former president of the American Historical Association and professor of history at UCLA, is the author of <i>Politics, Culture, and Class in the French Revolution</i> and co-author of <i>Telling the Truth About History</i>.This comprehensive work traces the development of human rights from its conceptual roots in the Enlightenment to its full expression in the United Nation's 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Hunt begins with a wonderfully detailed lexicographical survey of 18th century uses of rights language ("rights of man," "natural rights," "rights of humanity") to show the many currents that led to the first modern declaration of human rights, the Bill of Rights. She then triangulates the upswing in rights language with both the appearance of the novel of letters (such as Rousseau's Julie and Samuel Richardson's Pamela and Clarissa) and the rise of portraiture in the mid- to late-18th century. These particular art forms, she argues, fostered a sense of individuality in their audience and empathy for their subjects, most frequently "regular folks" rather than nobles, royalty, or saints. She then takes the reader through 250 years of rights legislation, covering the French Revolution's Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, various anti-torture measures and 20th century campaigns against human rights violations, among others. Despite the obvious academic grounding of this sweeping work, it is aimed at a wider audience and will appeal to most readers interested either in the history of human rights or in European or American history. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When one of the villagers too is killed people begin to wonder: could it be the work of a werewolf? Soon suspicion falls on Massart, one of the villagers, because of his beardlessness (according to popular legend, werewolves have no hair on their bodies because they are inside the body).<br><br>Soliman, the victim's adopted son; Le Veilleur, a lonely sheperd and Camille, a lovely girl from the city, decide to pursue Massart and their hunt leads them into the Alps, but their incompetence is undisguisable and they decide to summon Commissaire Adamsberg &#x2014; well known for his peculiar investigation methods &#x2014; to help. Thanks to his extraordinary intuition, Adamsberg unearths an astonishing truth, one that the villagers are going to find hard to believe.</p><p>Fred Vargas was born in Paris in 1957. As well as being a best-selling author in France, she is by training an historian and archaeologist.<b>I<br></b>On Tuesday, four sheep were killed at ventebrune in the French Alps. On Thursday, nine were lost at Pierrefort. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the wolves,&#x201d; a local said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re coming down to eat us all up.&#x201d; The other man drained his glass, then raised his hand. &#x201c;A wolf, Pierrot my lad. It&#x2019;s a wolf. A beast such as you have never clapped eyes on before.<br><br><b>II<br></b><br>Two men were lying prone in the undergrowth.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t reckon you&#x2019;re gonna teach me how to do my job, do you?&#x201d; said one.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t reckon anything,&#x201d; said the other. Tall, with long, fair hair. Name of Johnstone. Lawrence Donald Johnstone.<br><br>They lay quite still, gripping their binoculars, observing a pair of wolves. It was ten in the morning. The sun was scorching their backs.<br><br>&#x201c;That one is Marcus,&#x201d; Johnstone said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s come back.&#x201d;<br><br>His companion shook his head. A short, swarthy, rather pig-headed local. He had been keeping watch over the wolves in the Mercantour National Park for six years. Name of Jean Mercier.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Sibellius,&#x201d; he muttered.<br><br>&#x201c;Sibellius is much larger. Hasn&#x2019;t got that yellow tuft at the neck.&#x201d;<br><br>Jean Mercier was needled, so he reset his binoculars, brought the viewfinder once more into focus, and looked closely at the male wolf prowling round his family lair and occasionally sniffing the wind, some three hundred metres to the east of their hide. They were near, much too near, it would be better to pull back, but Johnstone wanted to get one or two good shots at any cost. That&#x2019;s why he was there &#x2013; to film wolves. Then he had to go back to Canada with his documentary in the can. But he had been putting off going back for six months, for reasons that were not entirely clear. To tell the truth, the Canadian was rooting in. Mercier knew why. Lawrence Donald Johnstone, celebrated connoisseur of Canadian grizzly bears, had fallen in love with a handful of European wolves. And he could not make up his mind to say so. In any case, the Canadian spoke as few words as he could get away with.<br><br>&#x201c;Came back in the spring,&#x201d; Johnstone muttered. &#x201c;Started a family. But I can&#x2019;t see who the she-wolf is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Proserpine,&#x201d; whispered Mercier. &#x201c;Out of Janus and Juno, third generation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Alongside Marcus.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Alongside Marcus,&#x201d; Mercier agreed, after a pause. &#x201c;And what&#x2019;s for sure is that there are brand-new cubs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excellent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How many?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Too soon to say.&#x201d;<br><br>Mercier jotted some notes on a pad attached to his belt, took a drink from his gourd, and got back into position without snapping a twig. Johnstone put down his binoculars, wiped the sweat off his face. He pulled over his camera, focused on Marcus and smiled as he switched it on. He had spent fifteen years among the grizzlies, the caribou and the wolves of Canada, wandering alone across the vast preserves to watch, record and film, occasionally stretching out a hand to the oldest of his untamed friends. Not creatures to be taken lightly. There&#x2019;d been Joan, an old female grizzly, who&#x2019;d come at him, her head down, to get a good scratch of her coat. And Johnstone had never imagined that Europe &#x2013; so pinched, so wasted and tamed &#x2013; could have anything of interest to offer him. He had not taken on this documentary job in the Mercantour Range very gladly. But what was he going to do?<br><br>And when it came to the crunch, he&#x2019;d kept putting off going home, he was dragging out his stay in this neck of the mountain. He was dragging his feet, to be blunt. He was hanging around for the sake of these European wolves with their paltry grey coats, no more than poor panting cousins of those thick-coated, brightly coloured Arctic beasts that deserved all his affection, or so he reckoned.He was hanging around for the sake of the swarming insects, the rivulets of sweat, the charred undergrowth and the crackling heat of the Mediterranean lands. &#x201c;Just you stick around, you haven&#x2019;t seen the half of it,&#x201d; Mercier would tell him rather pompously, with the proud manner of a hard-baked habitu� and survivor of solar onslaught. &#x201c;This is only June.&#x201d;<br><br>And he was hanging around, let&#x2019;s face it, for Camille.<br><br>Round here they called it &#x201c;rooting in&#x201d;.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t hold it against you&#x201d;, Mercier had said to him, quite seriously, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s better you know: you&#x2019;re rooting in.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;OK then, now I know,&#x201d; Johnstone had replied.<br><br>He stopped the camera, put it down gently on his rucksack and shaded it with a white canvas sheet.Young Marcus had gone off out of sight, heading north.<br><br>&#x201c;Gone to hunt before it gets really hot,&#x201d; Mercier observed.<br><br>Johnstone sprinkled water on his face, dampened his hat, took a dozen sips. Good Lord, what a sun. Never known anything so hellish.<br><br>&#x201c;Three cubs at least,&#x201d; Mercier mumbled.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m being fried alive,&#x201d; Johnstone said, grimacing as he passed a hand over his shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;Just you wait. You haven&#x2019;t seen the half of it.&#x201d;<br><br><b>III<br></b><br><i>Commissaire </i>Jean-Baptiste Adamsberg poured the pasta from the pan into the colander, watched distractedly as the water drained off, then dumped the whole lot on a plate. With grated cheese and tomato sauce, that would do fine for tonight. He&#x2019;d come home late after interrogating a cretin of a youth for hours on end, until eleven. Adamsberg was slow in any case. He did not like to rush things or people, however cretinous they might be. He especially did not like to rush himself. The television was on with the volume set low, nothing but wars, wars, and more wars.He ferreted about in the cutlery drawer, making all sorts of noise, found a fork, and stood in front of the set.<br><br><i>. . . wolves in the Mercantour National Park have once again gone on the attack in a locality in the department of the Alpes-Maritimes that had up to now been spared. This time, people are talking of an animal of unusual size. Truth or legend?

One false movement from Adamsberg and the guy might fly from the screen without finishing the terrific wolf story he&#x2019;d just begun. He turned up the sound and stepped back. Adamsberg was fond of wolves, the way you can be fond of your nightmares. His whole childhood in the Pyrenees had been shrouded in old folks&#x2019; accounts of the saga of the last wild wolves in France.When he walked the mountain paths in the dark, at the age of nine, when his father sent him out to gather kindling &#x2013; <i>no arguing, now</i> &#x2013; he used to think he could see yellow eyes trained on him all along the way. <i>Them eyes, sonny boy, them wolves&#x2019; eyes, they burn bright in the night, they do. Bright as a flaming brand.<br></i><br>Nowadays when he went back down to those parts, to his mountain home, he retraced the same paths in the pitch dark. That&#x2019;s what makes human beings so hopeless, really. They cling to the worst things they&#x2019;ve known.<br><br>He had heard it said &#x2013; a few years back &#x2013; that some wolves from the Abruzzi had crossed the Alps into France. Just a gang of tearaways, in a manner of speaking. Boozers on a night out. A friendly raid, a symbolic return, all hail and welcome to you three moth-eaten beasts from the Abruzzi. Ciao, fellas. Since when, he assumed, some guys had been pampering the predators on the sheltered marl of the Mercantour National Park, and the wolves had lunched on fresh lamb from time to time. But he had not seen such pictures before. So were those good lads from the Abruzzi suddenly getting violent? Adamsberg ate his pasta in silence as he watched sequences of dismembered sheep, bloodied soil, the gnarled face of a shepherd, and the stained carcass of one sheep that had been torn to pieces lying on meadow grass. The camera gave morbidly indulgent close-ups of the carnage, and the reporter plied the locals with leading questions, fanning the flames of anger among the country folk. They had edited into the news report shots of snarling wolves&#x2019; snouts lifted from old documentaries, more probably about the Balkans than about the Alps. It was enough to make you think that the whole hinterland of Nice was reeling under the onslaught of packs of wild beasts while aged shepherds stood their ground with pride, looking the enemy in the eye. <i>They burn bright in the night, they do, bright as a flaming brand.<br></i><br>But the facts were there. About thirty recorded wolves in the Mercantour, plus maybe a dozen lost cubs, along with feral dogs that were scarcely less threatening. Hundreds of sheep killed last season within a radius of ten kilometres around the Mercantour. These facts weren&#x2019;t aired in Paris because no-one in Paris gave a damn about stories of wolves and lambs, and Adamsberg was stupefied when he heard the figures. Today&#x2019;s two savagings in the canton of Auniers had reawakened the conflict.<br><br>A vet appeared on screen, pointing in a measured and professional manner at a gaping wound. No, there was not the slightest doubt about it, this is the bite of the upper jaw, fourth premolar on the right-hand side, see, and here, in front, this is the right-hand incisor, look here, and here, and on the underside, here. And do you see how far apart they are? These are the jaws of a very large canine.<br><br>&#x201c;Would you say it was a wolf, doctor?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Either that or a very large dog.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or a very big wolf?&#x201d;<br><br>Then another close-up of a defiant shepherd. Since those filthy predators had begun stuffing their bellies four years ago with the blessing of the folk up in Paris he had never seen wounds like these. Never. Fangs as big as your hand. The hill farmer gestured towards the mountains on the far horizon. It&#x2019;s on the prowl, right up there. A monster such as you have never seen before. They can snigger all they like, them folk in Paris, but they&#x2019;ll stop laughing pretty sharpish when they set their eyes on it.<br><br>Adamsberg watched in fascination as he stood eating the last of his cold pasta. The news anchor moved on to the next report. Wars.<br><br><i>Commissaire</i> Adamsberg sat down slowly and put his plate on the floor. Good lord, those Mercantour wolves. The innocent little pack they&#x2019;d started with had done a fair bit of growing. It had expanded its hunting ground canton by canton. Now it had overstepped the borders of the department of Alpes-Maritimes. And of the forty or so wolves up there, how many were predators? Did they hunt in packs? Or in pairs? Or was there just one lone wolf doing the damage? Yes, that&#x2019;s the way it was in stories &#x2013; a cruel and lonesome rogue, keeping his hindquarters low over his grey hind paws, slithering up to the village in the dark. A large beast. The Monster of Mercantour. And children asleep in the houses. Adamsberg closed his eyes. <i>They burn bright, my boy.

Her achievement is as breathtaking as the experiences of these women are awe-inspiring -- Viv Groskop * Observer * A revelation. . . Alexievich&#39;s text gives us precious details of the kind that breathe life into history . . . This is a book about emotions as much as it is about facts. It is not a historical document in the accepted sense. . . and yet ultimately, which historical documents are more important than this? -- Lyuba Vinogradova * Financial Times * A profoundly humbling, devastating book, it should be compulsory reading for anyone wishing to understand the experience of the war and its haunting legacy in the former Soviet Union -- Daniel Beer * Literary Review * These stories about the women warriors of Mother Russia are a symphony of feminine suffering and strength. . .

Alexievich put in thousands of hours with her tape recorder across the lands of the former Soviet Union, collecting and collating stories from ordinary people. She wove those tales into elegant books of such power and insight, that in 2015 she received the Nobel prize for literature -- Shaun Walker * Guardian * Alexievich&#39;s &#34;documentary novels&#34; are crafted and edited with a reporter&#39;s cool eye for detail and a poet&#39;s ear for the intricate rhythms of human speech. Reading them is like eavesdropping on a confessional. This is history at its rawest and most uncomfortably intimate. . . The book is not merely a corrective to male-centred accounts of conflict; it is a shattering and sometimes overwhelming experience -- Andrew Dickson * Evening Standard * A remarkable collection of testimonies. . . Sitting at kitchen tables, Alexievich coaxes out of the women stories that describe a reality vastly different from the officially sanctioned version * New Yorker * Magnificent. . . After decades of the war being remembered by &#39;men writing about men,&#39; she aims to give voice to an aging generation of women who found themselves dismissed not just as storytellers but also as veterans, mothers and even potential wives. . . Alexievich presents less a straightforward oral history of World War II than a literary excavation of memory itself * New York Times Book Review * A powerful and deeply moving document . . . giving voices to the women who served alongside their male counterparts only to have been rendered invisible, afterward, through sexist societal and bureaucratic systems * Vice * Reveals the harrowing, brave, and even quotidian memories of Soviet women whose voices were nearly stifled by the mores of history. These accounts fight our ingrained ideas about what makes a war story -- Sloane Crosley * Vanity Fair * The exploitation of the memory of the war has been the central element of modern Russian ideology. It is what makes Ms Alexievich&#39;s work so relevant today * Economist * A landmark in the study of female soldiers. . . Alexievich&#39;s method is the close interrogation of the past through the collection of individual voices; patient in overcoming cliche, attentive to the unexpected, and restrained in exposition, her writing reaches those far beyond her own experiences and preoccupations, far beyond her generation, and far beyond the lands of the former Soviet Union -- Timothy Snyder, author of On Tyranny Svetlana Alexievich rightly says she is a writer, not a historian. In her hands, the spoken word, even written down, conveys the vividness of individual experience, for it has the power of witness * Guardian * We should resolve to read this book alongside the world news report. . . Ms. Alexievich never tries to simplify. . . Refusing to pass judgment, crediting all, she listens, suffers and brings to life * Wall Street Journal *</p><h2>Alice&#39;s cook book: A culinary diversion</h2><p>Physical description; 119p. : ill. ; 26cm.

He'd claimed the flask was from an old pirate chest, but she'd discovered in the three years since his death at ninety-six that not everything he'd told her had been factual. Harry Bennett had been a grand spinner of the strategic tall tale. He'd probably been drinking rum from the flask when he'd spun the pirate-chest story.<br><br><em>No rum for me,</em> Samantha thought, glancing around her grandfather's cluttered office on the second floor of the Bennett house in Boston's Back Bay. She'd filled the flask with the smoky Scotch he had left in one of his crystal decanters. If she was going to hunt pirate's treasure, she figured she ought to have whiskey with her.<br><br>Although what could go wrong in little Knights Bridge, Massachusetts?<br><br>Her grandfather smiled at her from a framed black-and-white photograph hanging on the wood-paneled wall behind his massive oak desk. At the time of the photo he'd been forty-seven, roguishly handsome, wearing a jacket much like hers. He'd just arrived back in Boston after the Antarctic trip that had sealed his reputation as a world-class explorer and adventurer. It had almost killed him, too. Her couple of nights' camping in an out-of-the-way New England town hardly compared to an expedition to Antarctica.<br><br>She buttoned the flap of her jacket pocket. There were endless pockets inside and out. She was already forgetting where she'd put things-her phone, compass, matches, map, the earth-tone lipstick she'd grabbed at the last second, in case she went out to dinner one night during her stay in Knights Bridge.<br><br><em>Out to dinner? Where, with whom-and why?</em><br><br>If nothing else, a few days away from her grandfather's clutter would do her good. He had been born on a struggling New England farm and had died a wealthy man, if also a hopeless pack rat. Samantha hadn't realized just how much he'd collected in his long, active life until she'd been hired by his estate-meaning her father and her uncle-to go through his house and his London apartment. She swore she'd found gum wrappers from 1952. The man had saved <em>everything.</em><br><br>The morning sun streamed through translucent panels that hung over bowfront windows framed by heavy charcoal velvet drapes. Her grandmother, who had died twenty-five years ago, when Samantha was four, had decorated the entire house herself, decreeing that gray and white were the perfect colors for this room, for when her husband was there, being contemplative and studious-which wasn't often, even in his later years. He'd spent little time in his office, mostly just long enough to stack up his latest finds.<br><br>Samantha appreciated the effect of the filtered sunlight on the original oil painting that she'd unearthed from the office closet a few weeks ago. The painting was unsigned and clearly an amateur work, but it had captivated her from the moment she'd taken it out into the light. It depicted an idyllic red-painted New England cider mill, with apples in wooden crates, barrels of cider and a water wheel capturing the runoff from a small stone-and-earth dam on a woodland stream. She'd assumed it was untitled but two days ago had discovered neat, faded handwriting on the lower edge of the simple wood frame.<br><br><em>The Mill at Cider Brook.</em><br><br>Her surprise had been so complete that she'd dipped into the Scotch decanter.<br><br>She didn't know if the mill depicted in the painting was real, but there was a Cider Brook in Knights Bridge, barely two hours west of Boston.<br><br><em>Of all places.</em><br><br>A quick internet search had produced a year-old notice that the town of Knights Bridge was selling an old cider mill in its possession. Had someone bought it? Was it still for sale?<br><br>Samantha had checked the closet for anything else her grandfather might have stuffed in there related to Cider Brook. Instead, she discovered a legal-size envelope containing about fifty yellowed, handwritten pages-the rough draft of a story called <em>The Adventures of Captain Farraday and Lady Elizabeth.</em><br><br>She suspected but had no way to prove that the story was by the same hand as the painting, but it didn't matter. It had sealed the deal, and now she had Harry Bennett's antique silver flask tucked in her jacket and her plans made for her return to Knights Bridge-a town she had expected, and hoped, she would never have to visit again.<br><br>Plans more or less made, anyway. Samantha had no illusions about herself and knew she wasn't much on detailed planning.<br><br>Her first visit to the little town had been two and a half years ago, on a snowy March day a few months after her grandfather's death. She had expected to slip in and out of town without anyone's knowledge, but it hadn't worked out that way.<br><br><em>"A carpenter told me he saw a woman out here. You, Samantha?"</em><br><br>Yes. Her.<br><br>The carpenter had been her undoing. She didn't know who he was, but it didn't matter. She would be more careful on this trip, even if careful wasn't a Bennett trait.<br><br>This was her chance to put things right.<br><br>Samantha returned the painting to the closet, pulled the drapes, locked the doors and met her uncle and cousin out front. They had collected her grandfather's forty-year-old Mercedes from its parking space behind the house. It was a staid gray and had Massachusetts plates, but it was destined to stand out in Knights Bridge. In some ways, Harry Bennett's frugal upbringing had never left him. While he'd bought an expensive car, he'd decided to keep it until he ran it into the ground. It would have helped if he'd driven it once in a while, but he'd never liked to drive.<br><br>His younger son, however, loved to drive. Caleb Bennett was a rakishly handsome maritime historian in his early fifties. He and his wife, a rare-books specialist, lived outside London and were the parents of four, the eldest of whom, Isaac, a high-school senior, was strapped into the seat behind Samantha. Isaac and his father were heading to Amherst, the first stop on a tour of New England colleges. Samantha, who didn't own a car, was hitching a ride with them.<br><br>"This will be great," Caleb said as she got in next to him. "I can't remember the last time I drove into the New England countryside."<br><br>"Are you sure you don't want me to drive?"<br><br>"Nah. Sit back and enjoy yourself."<br><br>The three youngest Bennetts would be arriving in Boston with their mother that evening for a weeklong visit. At some point, Samantha's parents were due to arrive from the Scottish coast for an even shorter visit. A sort of family reunion. Her uncle and Isaac would pick her up in Knights Bridge on their way back to Boston.<br><br>Caleb pulled out onto busy Beacon Street. It was late September, a great time to be in Boston-or anywhere in New England. He glanced at Samantha. "You look as if you're about to walk the plank."<br><br>"Do I? I don't feel that way. I'm excited."<br><br>"That bastard Duncan McCaffrey fired you, Sam. Going back to Knights Bridge just picks the scab off a wound that should be healed by now."<br><br>Isaac leaned forward. "Duncan McCaffrey? The treasure hunter?"<br><br>Samantha's throat tightened, but she tried not to let them see her tension. She and Isaac shared the Bennett golden-brown hair and dark eyes, but he was lanky, angular and a gifted tennis player. She was active but had no patience for tennis, and, at five-five, she had obviously not inherited the Bennett height. Even her mother, Francesca, a marine archaeologist, was taller. Samantha considered herself lucky to have inherited her beautiful mother's high cheekbones and full mouth.<br><br>"That's right," she said finally. "I worked for Duncan for a short time. He's gone now. He died two years ago this past June."<br><br>"He fired your cousin three weeks before he died," Caleb put in.<br><br><em>Seventeen days, to be precise.</em> Samantha let it go. "I didn't tell him things he believed he was entitled to know," she said.<br><br>Isaac's eyes widened. "You lied to Duncan McCaffrey?"<br><br>"Not exactly."<br><br>Her cousin sat back in the soft leather seat. "Wow. That's got to haunt you. Talk about bad timing. What does Knights Bridge have to do with him?"<br><br>"I've heard stories in treasure-hunting circles, but I don't have all the details. Apparently Duncan was searching for information on his birth parents and ended up buying property in Knights Bridge. His son inherited it. Dylan. He's now engaged to a woman from town."<br><br>"Wait," Isaac said. "You're going there for revenge because Duncan fired you?"<br><br>"No. I'm not going for revenge." Samantha took a breath, not knowing what to say to her cousin, especially with her uncle right next to her. She'd already told Caleb more than she'd meant to. She exhaled, her tone matter-of-fact as she continued, "I'm going to test a theory."<br><br>Caleb grimaced next to her. "You're stirring things up for no good reason."<br><br>"Dylan McCaffrey doesn't even have to know I'm there."<br><br>"Sam..." There was a note of dread in Isaac's voice. "Sam, please tell me this trip isn't about pirates."<br><br>She swiveled around to look at him. "What, you don't like pirates, Isaac?"<br><br>"I got over pirates when I was twelve. Are you searching for the lost treasure of Captain Hook?"<br><br>"Show some respect, Isaac," his father said. "Samantha's an expert on East Coast privateers and pirates. Captain Hook is fictional. She's only interested in real pirates and such. Right, Sam?"<br><br>Samantha ignored the skeptical note in his voice. "I'm researching Captain Benjamin Farraday, a Boston privateer-turned-pirate who disappeared before he could be hanged for his crimes."<br><br>Isaac yawned as the Mercedes sped west on Storrow Drive, along the Charles River, which was dotted with small sailboats and Harvard rowers. "You think this Captain Farraday buried treasure in Knights Bridge?"<br><br>"It's possible."<br><br>Her cousin groaned. "Sam, nobody believes in buried treasure anymore."<br><br>His father glanced sideways at her. "You see? His mother's influence. He's got both feet planted firmly on the ground."<br><br>"He wants to go to Amherst College. That's Grandpa's alma mater." Samantha winked at her cousin in the backseat. "There's some Bennett in you."<br><br>Isaac rolled his eyes. "Don't remind me."<br><br>* * *<br><br>Dozing-and pretending to doze-on the drive west at least allowed Samantha to stop trying to convince her uncle that she hadn't lost her mind. He'd interrogated her on the contents of her backpack-he was pleased she had a first-aid kit and an emergency whistle-and her reasons for venturing to Knights Bridge on her own. <em>"You and this damn pirate, Samantha. You 're obsessed with this Captain Benjamin Farraday of yours."</em><br><br>No argument from her.<br><br>She hadn't mentioned the cider mill painting and the story she'd discovered in his father's Boston office. She had enough to overcome with her uncle without telling him she was off to Knights Bridge because of an anonymous painting and the fanciful writings of an unknown author-a woman, Samantha would guess given the feminine handwriting. She had no doubt her uncle would have dismissed <em>The Adventures of Captain Farraday and Lady Elizabeth</em> as worthless to a proper historian and tossed the pages into the fire.<br><br>Samantha had copied them and brought them with her, possible clues to her pirate mystery, as well as a reminder of the reasons she was undertaking this mission and returning to Knights Bridge. It was a fun story. One particular passage had stuck in her mind.<br><br><em>Lady Elizabeth Fullerton refused to choke on the terrible rum the black-haired, black-eyed pirate had thrust at her. "What's your name?" she asked, returning the flask to him.</em><br><br><em>"Farraday. Benjamin Farraday. And yours?"</em><br><br><em>"Bess." She 'd already considered what name to give him. Something simple and not too far from the truth, so that she wouldn't forget. "Bess Fuller."</em><br><br><em>He grinned and leaned in close to her. He obviously didn't believe her. "Well, Bess Fuller, drink up. We've a long way to go before you'll see England again. You can thank me later for saving you."</em><br><br><em>"I'd rather have drowned than to be rescued by a pirate rogue."</em><br><br>It was a rousing tale of a spirited high-born British woman who'd been captured for ransom by a dastardly enemy of her remote but wealthy father and then "rescued" by a dashing pirate. Although entertaining, the story bore only marginal resemblance to the life of the real Farraday-at least his known life. There was much not yet known about the Boston-born pirate and his exploits.<br><br>Samantha had her grandfather to thank for sparking her interest in Captain Farraday. A few months before his death, he had plunked a copy of an eighteenth-century broadside in front of her. It detailed the crimes credited against Farraday, then a wanted man. <em>"You like pirates, Sam. Check out this guy."</em><br><br>She had dived in. As her grandfather's health quickly had begun to fail, he loved for her to sit at his bedside and tell him every new development in her research. She had theorized that Farraday might have hidden treasure in the wilderness west of Boston, first as his personal insurance policy against his capture, arrest and ultimate execution, then to finance a new sloop to continue his raids on other ships.<br><br>She had little to go on-no proof beyond snippets here and there and her leaps to connect the dots of her research. She didn't know why her grandfather hadn't told her about the painting and the manuscript pages in his closet-he could have simply forgotten they were there. Now she suspected at least the story had brought Captain Farraday to his attention in the first place.<br><br>"Samantha-Samantha, we're here."<br><br>She sat up straight at her uncle's voice. "Right. So we are."<br><br>He slowed the old Mercedes as they came to the Knights Bridge town common, an oval-shaped green encircled by a narrow main street with classic homes, a town hall, a library, a general store and a few other businesses.<br><br>Caleb shuddered. "This place is straight out of 1910."<br><br>"It just looks that way on the surface." She pointed vaguely. "You can drop me off anywhere here."<br><br>He stopped in front of the Swift River Country Store. "What about mosquitoes? Ticks? I hope you packed DEET."<br><br>"DEET and Scotch," Samantha said lightly. "The necessities when hunting pirate treasure."<br><br>Caleb looked at his son. "You're going to be an engineer."<br><br>Isaac managed to stir enough to wish her luck. As she grabbed her pack out of the backseat, she caught him smirking and muttering something about hoping she found herself a sexy pirate of her own.<br><br>"This isn't about sexy pirates," she told him.<br><br>He gave her a knowing grin. "Right. It's about scholarship."<br><br>She ignored him. "Enjoy your college tour." She smiled at her uncle. "Thanks for the ride. I'll see you in a few days."<br><br>"Have fun. Steer clear of carpenters."<br><br>Samantha wished she hadn't told her uncle how Duncan McCaffrey had come to fire her. Being spotted in the snow by a small-town carpenter paled in comparison to some of the ways her father and his baby brother had gotten themselves into trouble over the years.<br><br>Caleb and Isaac didn't linger. Samantha waited for the Mercedes to disappear back out the winding road to the highway before she set off. There was nothing she needed to pick up at the general store. She didn't have to ask for directions-she had a paper map and a map on her phone, but she'd committed her route to memory.<br><br></p><h2>Hypnotism and Mysticism of India</h2><p>What makes all forms of magic and mysticism are the secrets. This book might well be called the &#34;textbook&#34; of the Hindu magicians, and it reveals secrets that have been handed down from father to son for centuries in India. The origina ldraft of this work was written in Calcutta in collaboration with Sadhu Parimal Bandhu. Those who are familiar with Ormond McGill&#39;s The Secret World of Witchcraft and Religious Mysteries of the Orient, coauthored with his partner, Ron Ormond, will recognize the name of Parimal Bandhu. He is a Hindu sage of magnificcent knowledge. Most likely, it was because of his warm friendship with Ron Ormond and his appreciation of Ormond McGill&#39;s professional interest in magic,as an American magician and hypnotist, that he so generously revealed these secrets of Yoga magical and mystical teachings. Also, the Sadhu was a man of high intuitive powers, so it is entirely possible that he sensed the time as being right for now opening to western people this phase of the esoteric wisdom of the Orient. First, you will be shown how to perform some of the clever Hindu Fakir magic: you will learn the secrets of &#34;The Growing Mango Tree,&#34; &#34;The Hindu Basket Trick,&#34; &#34;The Dry Sand Trick,&#34; &#34;The Diving Duck,&#34; and numerous others of India&#39;s classical mysteries that co completely baffle the tourists. And how would you like to learn the secret of the legendary &#34;East Indian Rope Trick?&#34; You are given the explanation. You advance into a knowledge of the high magic of India and are taught in the reading of the Akashic records, astral projection, and Yoga cosmology. And you learn how to perform Yama, the Yoga method of self-development that is said to make a man over completely anew.Further, through the kind cooperation of the government of India, a wonderful picture gallery of some of India&#39;s most remarkable artistic and archetectural heritage is given in this book</p><p></p><h2>1635: The Wars for the Rhine (24) (Ring of Fire)</h2><p>An exciting addition to the multiple&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>best-selling&nbsp;Ring of Fire alternate history&nbsp;series created by Eric Flint. Time travelers from our modern age are thrown into the deadly straits of the&nbsp;Thirty Years War in Europe of the 1600s.<br><br>In the year 1635, the Rhineland is in turmoil. The impact of the Ring of Fire, the cosmic accident which transported the small modern West Virginia town of Grantville to Europe in the early seventeenth century, has only aggravated a situation that was already chaotic. Perhaps nowhere in central Europe did the Thirty Years War produce so much upheaval as it did in the borderlands between France and Germany.<br> <br> Archbishop Ferdinand of Cologne shares the religious fanaticism of his older brother, Duke Maximilian of Bavaria. He is determined to restore the power of the Catholic Church over the middle Rhine, the so-called &#x201c;Bishop&#x2019;s Alley,&#x201d; and has unleashed a plot for that purpose. But that same middle Rhine is territory which Landgrave William V of Hesse-Kassel is determined to seize for himself, under the guise of expanding the influence of the United States of Europe.<br> <br> Add to the witch's brew the deaths in battle of Duke Wolfgang of J�lich-Berg and his son, which leaves his young widow Katharina Charlotte as the heir to those much-prized territories.

Somebody had to&#39; And, as soon as Bill Bryson was old enough, he left. Des Moines couldn&#39;t hold him, but it did lure him back. After ten years in England, he returned to the land of his youth, and drove almost 14,000 miles in search of a mythical small town called Amalgam, the kind of trim and sunny place where the films of his youth were set. Instead, his search led him to Anywhere, USA; a lookalike strip of gas stations, motels and hamburger outlets populated by lookalike people with a penchant for synthetic fibres. Travelling around thirty-eight of the lower states - united only in their mind-numbingly dreary uniformity - he discovered a continent that was doubly lost; lost to itself because blighted by greed, pollution, mobile homes and television; lost to him because he had become a stranger in his own land. The Lost Continent is a classic of travel literature - hilariously, stomach-achingly funny, yet tinged with heartache - and the book that first staked Bill Bryson&#39;s claim as the most beloved writer of his generation.</p><p>A travelogue by Bill Bryson is as close to a sure thing as funny books get. <i>The Lost Continent</i> is no exception. Following an urge to rediscover his youth (he should know better), the author leaves his native Des Moines, Iowa, in a journey that takes him across 38 states. Lucky for us, he brought a notebook. <p> With a razor wit and a kind heart, Bryson serves up a colorful tale of boredom, kitsch, and beauty when you least expect it. Gentler elements aside, <i>The Lost Continent</i> is an amusing book. Here's Bryson on the women of his native state: "I will say this, however--and it's a strange, strange thing--the teenaged daughters of these fat women are always utterly delectable ... I don't know what it is that happens to them, but it must be awful to marry one of those nubile cuties knowing that there is a time bomb ticking away in her that will at some unknown date make her bloat out into something huge and grotesque, presumably all of a sudden and without much notice, like a self-inflating raft from which the pin has been yanked." </p><p> Yes, Bill, but be honest: what do you really think?</p>" <i>I come from Des Moines.

After ten years in England he returned to the land of his youth, and drove almost 14,000 miles in search of a mythical small town called Amalgam, the kind of smiling village where the movies from his youth were set. Instead he drove through a series of horrific burgs, which he renamed Smellville, Fartville, Coleslaw, Coma, and Doldrum. At best his search led him to Anywhere, USA, a lookalike strip of gas stations, motels and hamburger outlets populated by obese and slow-witted hicks with a partiality for synthetic fibres.

Though piano playing was a crucial art for these thinkers, their musings on the subject are largely scant, implicit, or discordant with each philosopher's oeuvre. Noudelmann both recovers and integrates these perspectives, showing that the manner in which these philosophers played, the composers they adored, and the music they chose reveals uncommon insight into their thinking styles and patterns.<br><br>Noudelmann positions the physical and theoretical practice of music as a dimension underpinning and resonating with Sartre's, Nietzsche's, and Barthes's unique philosophical outlook. By reading their thought against their music, he introduces new critical formulations and reorients their trajectories, adding invaluable richness to these philosophers' lived and embodied experiences. The result heightens the multiple registers of being and the relationship between philosophy and the senses that informed so much of their work. A careful reader of music, Noudelmann maintains an elegant command of the texts under his gaze and appreciates the discursive points of musical and philosophical scholarship they involve, especially with regard to recent research and cutting-edge critique.</p><p><p>The contemporary French intellectual scores the play of music and thought in the work of three modern philosophers.</p>Fran�ois Noudelmann is professor of philosophy at l'Universit� Paris VIII.

Born in Miami, Florida, he earned his B.S. in physics at the University of Miami (1967, Coral Gables, Fla.) and his M.A. in physics at Columbia University (1968, New York, N.Y.) where he was a Faculty Fellow. During his three-year term with the United States Peace Corps in Bogot�, Colombia, Fogel taught physics and worked on developing physics curricula for high schools. Through this experience, Fogel became interested in how people learn, which led to his completion of a Ph.D. in education, in 1976, with a focus on early childhood development, at the University of Chicago. <p> Dr. Fogel is active as a researcher and author. He has written books on early social and communicative development, Developing through Relationships (University of Chicago Press, 1993) and Change processes in relationships: A relational historical research approach. (with A. Garvey, H. Hsu, &amp; D. West-Stroming, Cambridge University Press, 2006). He has co-edited multiple books on research in child development: Emotion and Early Interaction (with Tiffany Field, 1982), Origins of Nurturance: Biological, Cultural, and Developmental Perspectives in Caregiving (with Gail F. Melson, 1985), and Dynamics and Indeterminism in Social and Developmental Processes (with Maria Lyra and Jaan Valsiner, 1997), the Handbook of Infant Development (with Gavin Bremner, 2001), and Human development in the 21st century: Visionary policy ideas from systems scientists (with Barbara J.

She is the author of many remarkable books for children, including, Who Built the Pyramids? and Endurance: Shackleton&#39;s Perilous Expedition in Antarctica.Grade 3-5 - Eight castles in Europe, one in Syria, and one in Japan are featured, with a chronological arrangement from the 12th to the 19thcentury. Detailed drawings of each structure fill a spread, followed by a two-page action account of the particular castle - usually a historical event taking place in the course of a single day - accompanied by numerous thumbnail sketches and an occasional fictional character. The parts of the castle mentioned in the text are numbered on the tiny thumbnails, enabling readers to locate them on the large rendering at the beginning of the section. The illustrations of the castles feature cutaways and see-through walls, which are occasionally confusing, and appear to show only parts of the outlying areas. Overall, there is plenty to pore over here, but children will need to look elsewhere for a more complete picture of these magnificent buildings and their many functions.<i> - Lynda S.

Here, a young man's life is about poking at the pretensions of the city's elders with American music, bad poetry, and slightly better journalism. And then, his life in Chicago: watching from afar as war breaks out in Sarajevo and the city comes under siege, no way to return home; his parents and sister fleeing Sarajevo with the family dog, leaving behind all else they had ever known; and Hemon himself starting a new life, his own family, in this new city.</p><p> And yet this is not really a memoir. <i>The Book</i> <i>of My Lives</i>, Hemon's first book of nonfiction, defies convention and expectation. It is a love song to two different cities; it is a heartbreaking paean to the bonds of family; it is a stirring exhortation to go out and play soccer&#x2015;and not for the exercise. It is a book driven by passions but built on fierce intelligence, devastating experience, and sharp insight. And like the best narratives, it is a book that will leave you a different reader&#x2015;a different person, with a new way of looking at the world&#x2015;when you've finished.

WHO IS THAT?<br>On the evening of March 27, 1969, my father was in Leningrad, USSR, in pursuit of his advanced electrical engineering degree. My mother was at home, in Sarajevo, deep in labor, attended to by a council of her women friends. She had her hands on her round belly, huffing and crying, but the council didn&#x2019;t seem too worried. I was orbiting around her, exactly four and a half years old, trying to hold her hand or sit in her lap, until I was sent to bed and ordered to sleep. I defied the order so as to monitor the developments through the (somewhat Freudian) keyhole. I was terrified, naturally, for even if I knew that there was a baby in her stomach, I still didn&#x2019;t know how exactly it was all going to work, what was going to happen to her, to us, to me. When she was eventually taken to the hospital in obvious and audible pain, I was left behind with terror-provoking thoughts, which teta-Jozefina tried to counter with the guarantees that my mother would not die, that she would come back with a brother or sister for me. I did want my mother to come back; I did not want a brother or sister; I wanted everything to be the way it was, the way it already used to be. The world had harmoniously belonged to me; indeed, the world had pretty much been me.<br>But nothing has ever been&#x2014;nor will it ever be&#x2014;the way it used to be. A few days later, I was accompanied by a couple of adults (whose names and faces have sunk to the sandy bottom of an aging mind&#x2014;all I know about them is that neither of them was my father, who was still in the USSR) to retrieve my mother from the hospital. One thing I remember: she was not half as happy to see me as I was to see her. On our way home, I shared the backseat with her and a bundle of stuff they claimed was alive&#x2014;that was supposed to be my sister. The alleged sister&#x2019;s face was seriously crumpled, containing only an ugly, indefinable grimace. Moreover, her face was dark, as though she were soot-coated. When I traced my finger across her cheek, a pale line appeared under the soot. &#x201c;She is filthy,&#x201d; I announced to the adults, but none of them acknowledged the problem. From thereon in, it would be hard for me to have my thoughts heard and my needs met. Also, chocolate would be hard to get.<br>Thus my sooty alleged sister&#x2019;s arrival marked the beginning of a tormentful, lonely period in my early development. Droves of people (bringing chocolate I couldn&#x2019;t touch) came to our home to lean over her and produce ridiculous sounds. Few of them cared about me, while the attention they paid to her was wholly, infuriatingly undeserved: she did nothing but sleep and cry and undergo frequent diaper changes. I, on the other hand, could already read small words, not to mention speak fluently, and I knew all kinds of interesting things: I could recognize flags of various countries; I could easily distinguish between wild and farm animals; cute pictures of me were all over our house. I had knowledge, I had ideas, I knew who I was. I was myself, a person, beloved by everyone.<br>For a while, as painful as her existence was to me, she was but a new thing, something you had to get around to get to Mother, like a new piece of furniture or a wilted plant in a large pot. But then I realized that she was going to stay and be a permanent obstacle, that Mother&#x2019;s love for me might never reach pre-sister levels. Not only did my new sister impinge upon what used to be my world, but she also obliviously asserted herself&#x2014;despite having no self at all&#x2014;into its very center. In our house, in my life, in my mother&#x2019;s life, every day, all the time, forever, she was there&#x2014;the soot-skinned not-me, the other.<br>Therefore I tried to exterminate her as soon as an opportunity presented itself. One spring day, Mother stepped out of the kitchen to pick up the phone and left her alone with me. My father was still in Russia, and she was probably talking to him. Mother did stay out of my sight for a while, as I watched the little creature, her unreadable face, her absolute absence of thought or personality, her manifest insubstantiality, her unearned presence. So I started choking her, pressing my thumbs against her windpipe, as seen on television. She was soft and warm, alive, and I had her existence in my hands. I felt her tiny neck under my fingers, I was causing her pain, she was squirming for life. Suddenly, I recognized that I shouldn&#x2019;t be doing what I was doing, I shouldn&#x2019;t be killing her, because she was my little sister, because I loved her. But the body is always ahead of the thought and I kept up the pressure for another moment, until she started vomiting curdled breast milk. I was terrified with the possibility of losing her: her name was Kristina; I was her big brother; I wanted her to live so I could love her more. But, although I knew how I could end her life, I didn&#x2019;t know how I could stop her from dying.<br>My mother heard her desperate cries, dropped the phone, and ran to her aid. She picked my sister up, calmed her down, wiped off the curds, made her inhale and breathe, then demanded an explanation from me. My just-discovered love for my sister and the related feeling of guilt did not at all displace my self-protective instincts: I bold-facedly stated that she&#x2019;d started crying and I&#x2019;d merely put my hand over her mouth to prevent her from bothering Mother. Throughout my boyhood I always knew more and better than my parents thought I did&#x2014;I was always a little older than what they could see. In this instance, I shamelessly claimed good intentions coupled with little-boy ignorance, and so I was warned and forgiven. There is no doubt I was monitored for a while, but I haven&#x2019;t tried to kill Kristina since, loving her uninterruptedly.<br>The recollection of that sororicide attempt is the earliest memory in which I can observe myself from outside: what I see is me <i>and</i> my sister. Never again would I be alone in the world, never again would I have it exclusively for myself. Never again would my selfhood be a sovereign territory devoid of the presence of others. Never again would I have all the chocolate for myself.<br>2. WHO ARE WE?<br>When I was growing up in Sarajevo in the early seventies, the dominant social concept among the kids was <i>raja</i>. If one had any friends at all, one had a <i>raja</i>, but normally the <i>raja</i> was defined by the part of town or the building complex one lived in&#x2014;we spent most of our nonschool time playing in the streets. Each <i>raja</i> had a generational hierarchy. The <i>velika raja</i> were the older kids, whose responsibilities included protecting the <i>mala raja</i>&#x2014;the smaller kids&#x2014;from abuse or pocket-emptying by some other <i>raja</i>. The older kids&#x2019; rights included unconditional obedience on the part of the <i>mala raja</i>, who could thus always be deployed to buy cigarettes, naked-lady magazines, beer, and condoms, or to volunteer their heads for the <i>velika raja</i>&#x2019;s merciless filliping practice&#x2014;my head was often submitted to a cannonade of the dreaded <i>mazzola</i>s. Many <i>raja</i>s were defined by and named after their leader, usually the strongest, toughest kid. We feared, for example, the <i>raja</i> of Ciza, who was a well-known <i>jalija</i>&#x161;, a street thug. Normally, Ciza was old enough to be gainfully invested in various forms of petty crime, so we never saw him. He acquired a mythological quality, while his younger brother Zeko ran the daily operations of doing nothing in particular. It was he who we feared most.<br>My <i>raja</i> was a lesser, weak one, as we had no leader at all&#x2014;all of our older boys, alas, took school seriously. We were defined by a playground between the two symmetrical, socialistically identical buildings in which we lived; we called it the Park. In the geopolitics of our neighborhood (known back then as Stara stanica&#x2014;the Old Train Station) we were known as the Parka&#x161;i. The Park not only contained playground equipment&#x2014;a slide, three swings, sandbox, merry-go-round&#x2014;but there were benches as well, which served as goals whenever we played soccer. There were also, more important, the bushes where we had our <i>loga</i>&#x2014;our base, the place where we could escape from Ciza&#x2019;s marauding <i>raja</i>, where we hoarded things stolen from our parents or pilfered from other, feebler kids. The Park was therefore our rightful domain, our sovereign territory, on which no stranger, let alone a member of another <i>raja</i>, could trespass&#x2014;any suspected foreigner was subject to preemptive frisking or punitive attack. Once we waged a successful campaign against a bunch of teenagers who mistakenly thought that our Park was a good place for smoking, drinking, and mutual fondling. We threw at them rocks and wet sand wrapped in paper, we charged collectively at the isolated ones, breaking long sticks against their legs as they helplessly swung their short arms. Occasionally, some other <i>raja</i> would try to invade and take control of the Park and we would fight a war&#x2014;heads were cracked, bodies bruised, all and any of us risking a grievous injury. Only when Zeko and his troopers&#x2014;our more powerful nemesis&#x2014;came to the Park did we have to stand back and watch them swing on our swings, slide on our slide, piss in our sandbox, shit in our bushes. All we could do was imagine merciless revenge, deferred into an indefinite but certain future.<br>Now it seems to me that when I wasn&#x2019;t in school or reading books, I was involved in some collective project of my <i>raja</i>. Besides protecting the sovereignty of the Park and waging various wars, we spent time at one another&#x2019;s homes, swapped comic books and football stickers, sneaked together into the nearby movie theater (Kino Arena), searched for evidence of sexual activity in our parents&#x2019; closets, and attended one another&#x2019;s birthday parties. My primary loyalty was to my <i>raja</i> and any other collective affiliation was e...</p><h2>Fright</h2><p>When he murders his blackmailing mistress on the day of his wedding, Prescott Marshall goes on the run with his new bride, in this gripping noir crime novel, lost for more than half a century and never before published under the author&#39;s real name.

It has become for him a pursuit, or pilgrimage of the heart, that has taken him across three centuries, through much of Europe, and into the lively company of many earlier biographers. Central to this quest is a powerful and tender evocation of the lives of women both scientific and literary, some well-known and some almost lost to history: Margaret Cavendish, Mary Somerville, Germaine de Sta�l, Mary Wollstonecraft, and the Dutch intellectual Z�lide. Holmes also investigates the myths that have overshadowed the lives of some favorite Romantic figures: the love-stunned John Keats, the waterlogged Percy Bysshe Shelley, the chocolate-box painter Thomas Lawrence, the opium-soaked genius Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and the mad visionary bard William Blake.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; The diversity of Holmes&#x2019;s material is a testimony to his empathy, erudition, and inquiring spirit&#x2014;and, sometimes, to his mischievous streak. <i>The Long Pursuit </i>gives us a unique insider&#x2019;s account of a biographer at work: traveling, teaching, researching, fantasizing, forgetting, and even ballooning. From this great chronicler of the Romantics now comes a chronicle of himself and his intellectual passions; it contains his most personal and most seductive writing.</p><p><b>RICHARD HOLMES</b> is the author of <i>The Age of Wonder, </i>which won the Royal Society Prize for Science Books and the National Book Critics Circle Award, was short-listed for the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction, and was one of <i>The New York Times Book Review&#x2019;</i>s Best Books of the Year in 2009.

He lives in Great Britain.1 Travelling<br> &nbsp;<br> Every so often I close one of my working notebooks (there are nearly two hundred of them now, dating from 1964, the earliest in soft blue crumpled cardboard from Woolworths, the most recent in glossy black spiral-bound A5 hardback, from Black n&#x2019; Red) and begin to reflect on the whole journey, and the time left, and what if anything I have learned along the way. I look back at the highways and byways of biography, my own <i>Footsteps </i>and my <i>Sidetracks</i>, and most of all on my strange, unappeased sense of some continuous, intense and inescapable pursuit. <br><br> I remember, for instance, the early summer of 1974, when I had just finished my first book, a biography of the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was eight hundred pages long and I was nearly thirty. I had travelled in England, Scotland, Ireland, France and Italy in search of my fiery, footloose poet. I felt like a veteran after a long campaign in the field. I felt grizzled, anecdotal, displaced. What&#x2019;s more, I found that I had returned with two conclusions about writing biography that were certainly not taught back home in academia. <br><br> The first was the Footsteps principle. I had come to believe that the serious biographer must <i>physically </i>pursue his subject through the past. Mere archives were not enough. He must go to all the places where the subject had ever lived or worked, or travelled or dreamed. Not just the birthplace, or the blue-plaque place, but the temporary places, the passing places, the lost places, the dream places. <br><br> He &#x2013; or she &#x2013; must examine them as intelligently as possible, looking for clues, for the visible and the invisible, for the history, the geography and the atmosphere. He must feel how they once were; must imagine what impact they might once have had. He must be alert to &#x2018;unknown modes of being&#x2019;. He must step back, step down, step inside the story. <br><br> The second was the Two-Sided Notebook concept. It seemed to me that a proper research notebook must always have a form of &#x2018;double accounting&#x2019;. There should be a distinct, conscious divide between the objective and the subjective sides of the project. This meant keeping a double-entry record of all research as it progressed (or, as frequently, digressed). Put schematically, there must be a right-hand side and a left-hand side to every notebook page spread. <br><br> On the one (the right) I would record the objective facts of my subject&#x2019;s life, as minutely and accurately as possible (from the letters, the diaries, the memoirs, the archives). But on the other (the left) I would also record my most personal responses, my feelings and speculations, my questions and conundrums, my difficulties and challenges, my travels and my visions. Irritation, embarrassment, puzzlement or grief could prove as valuable as excitement, astonishment, inspiration or enthusiasm. The cumulative experience of the research journey, of being in my subject&#x2019;s company over several years, thus became part of the whole biographical enterprise. Only in this way, it seemed to me, could I use, but also hope to master, the biographer&#x2019;s most valuable but perilous weapon: empathy. <br><br> One incident from long before the Shelley days, during my novice pursuit of Robert Louis Stevenson in the C�vennes a decade previously, became an unlikely talisman. It never got into <i>Footsteps</i>, but lay quietly on the left-hand page of my very first notebook for over twenty years. Only much later, when I began to lecture about biography, did I find myself unexpectedly retelling it. To my surprise, it went through various versions, until it had finally metamorphosed from a traveller&#x2019;s tale into a kind of biographer&#x2019;s parable. In its developed form it went like this.<br><br> I first explained that I was eighteen, and in following Stevenson through the wild C�vennes, I usually slept out deliberately like him under the stars, in a small sleeping bag without a tent, <i>� la belle �toile</i>. But sometimes I was reluctantly forced (by the spectacular C�vennes storms) to spend a night at one of the little remote country inns or hostels. In those days you had to present a passport to be entered in the <i>fichi�re</i>, with your name, age and occupation included in the details. Under occupation, I had specified with great optimism &#x2018;Writer&#x2019;. Of course I had published absolutely <i>nothing </i>at that point. <br><br> When I handed over my passport to Madame at the reception desk, the same thing always seemed to happen. &#x2018;Ah, Monsieur &#x2019;Olmez,&#x2019; she would exclaim grimly as she filled in the little buff index card, &#x2018;I see you are a waiter.&#x2019; I reflected painfully on this for some days, and then thought of putting in &#x2018;Travel Writer&#x2019;. But then I could immediately hear the even grimmer response. &#x2018;Ah, Monsieur &#x2019;Olmez, I see you are a table waiter.&#x2019; <br><br> This tale, suitably embellished with Gallic accents and hand gestures, became known as my &#x2018;travelling waiter joke&#x2019;. Yet it gradually revealed to me a serious lesson in professional humility. Because in a sense that&#x2019;s exactly what a biographer is: someone who waits, who <i>awaits</i>, who pays attention, who is constantly alert, who attends upon his subjects, who is <i>at their service </i>for a long period of faithful employment. Waiting done well, I reflected, involves a lot of legwork. <br><br> Accordingly, my next pursuit, in the service of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, lasted, on and off, for nearly fifteen years and progressed through some thirty two-sided notebooks. It took me to the English West Country and Lake District, to Germany, to Italy, to Sicily, to Malta, and finally to a quiet garden on Highgate Hill in London. It ended in nine hundred pages over two volumes. We both aged considerably in the process. <br><br> Coleridge was himself the master of the notebook &#x2013; over seventy of them survive, thanks to the life&#x2019;s work of the Canadian scholar Kathleen Coburn. The first was begun in Bristol in 1794, when he was twenty-one; the last was left incomplete at his death in Highgate in 1834. They provide a wonderful underground river for the biographer, an entry into Coleridge&#x2019;s mind and heart, his inner life, not least in his relations with William and Dorothy Wordsworth, and his secret beloved or <i>femme fatale</i>, his &#x2018;Asra&#x2019;, Sara Hutchinson. <br><br> The notebooks are as multifarious, elusive and incorrigible as the man. They contain his fantastic reading lists, his extraordinary nightmares, his brilliant lecture notes, his hectic fell-walking diaries, his endless self-psychoanalysis sessions, his battles with opium addiction, his excruciating medical symptoms (teeth, lungs, bowels), his sexual hauntings and obsessions, his labyrinthine thoughts about science and religion, his ghastly puns and his moving prayers. <br><br> They are also full of wonderful oddities: the draft of a comic novel, the recipe for making waterproof shoe polish, accounts of erotic dreams (partially in Greek and usually connected with food), the sayings of his child Hartley, notes on the sounds of different bird- song, or observations on different kinds and modalities of rainfall. All the time, like the underground river of &#x2018;Kubla Khan&#x2019;, there is a continual bubbling up of images that would appear in both his poetry and his later criticism; but also a continuous stream of self-definition. <br><br> I remember discovering, like a sudden gold-strike, this description of a tiny waterfall on the River Greta, which he wrote when he first came to the Lake District in 1800: &#x2018;Shootings of water threads down the slope of the huge green stone ... The white Eddy-rose that blossomed up against the Stream in the scollop, by fits and starts, Obstinate in resurrection &#x2013; It is the Life that we live.&#x2019; <br><br> It instantly struck me that Coleridge was describing himself &#x2013; &#x2018;obstinate in resurrection&#x2019;. Now I can never see a stream flowing over a stone, with that bubbling backwash of foam (so brilliantly defined as the &#x2018;Eddy-rose&#x2019;), without thinking of his biography. There is his complex, mysterious and in many ways disastrous life, which was nevertheless perpetually renewed, miraculously foaming back in words, &#x2018;obstinate in resurrection&#x2019;. It was indeed the life that he lived. I gradually realised it was also the Life that I needed to write. <br><br> Coleridge&#x2019;s travels were geographical as well as metaphysical, and true to the Footsteps principle I followed him faithfully. In exchange, Coleridge taught me many lessons about biography during these research trips or solitary pursuits. I followed his walk over the wild Quantock Hills and down to the tiny seaport at Watchet where he began <i>The Ancient Mariner </i>with Wordsworth in 1797.<br> Here the Bristol Channel surges out towards the Atlantic, producing one of the most astonishing tidal swings in the whole of northern Europe, rising and falling over thirty feet in twelve hours. Watching the fishing boats locked in its muscular grasp, I understood something new about the submarine &#x2018;Polar Spirit&#x2019; of the deep, that pursued the Mariner after he had killed the albatross; and more than that, some- thing of the huge tides that had always swept through Coleridge&#x2019;s own life. <br><br> I went out to G�ttingen in Germany, where he had attended the scientific lectures of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in 1799, read the <i>Naturphilosophie </i>of Friedrich Schelling, from which his own ideas about Nature, Form and the Unconscious would eventually develop in &#x2018;genial coincidence&#x2019;. He became fascinated by the story of the <i>Walpurgisnacht </i>(or Witching Night) on the nearby Brocken mountain, which later appears in Goethe&#x2019;s <i>Faust </i>(1808). Typically, Coleridge had climbed the Brocken to interview the legendary &#x2018;Brocken spectre&#x2019; for himself, in a mixed spirit of scientific and poetic enquiry. Clambering up after him through the dark colon- nades of the Harz forest, I came across a different kind of witchcraft. <br><br> Panting up through a clearing of pine trees, I burst upon a sort of surreal Faustian theatre set. It was decked with skull-like signs announcing &#x2018;<i>Halt! Hier Grenze!</i>&#x2019;, and promising imminent death. I had stumbled upon the huge, sinister double border fence, sown with landmines and automatic machine-guns, dividing East and West Germany. Like the moment twenty years before, when, na�vely retracing Robert Louis Stevenson&#x2019;s <i>Travels with a Donkey in the C�vennes</i>, I had come down to his symbolic river bridge at Langogne, and to my profound dismay found that it was broken and impassable, his time literally divided from my time. This was another sharp lesson in the irrecoverability of the past. <br><br> Another trip took me to Malta, where, in the unlikely role of wartime civil service secretary, Coleridge promulgated by-laws, visited military hospitals (appalled by the syphilitic cases, several to a bed), wrote political propaganda, and clean-copied the last despatches from Governor Admiral Ball to Nelson before the Battle of Trafalgar. <br><br> His shape-shifting during this period, 1804&#x2013;05, is extraordinary, yet characteristic. At Valletta, I found that his lonely rooms in the Governor&#x2019;s Palace directly overlooked the harbour. Having borrowed a naval telescope, the bustling secretary somehow disappeared for hours, studying the many ships arriving and departing, dosing his homesickness with opium and erotic poetry, and writing learned notes on &#x2018;organic form&#x2019;. <br><br> It was here I found Coleridge unexpectedly praying to the moon. His strange, metaphysical account of &#x2018;Sabaism&#x2019;, or sun- and moon-worship, had previously gone unnoticed. But it told me some- thing crucial about his religious beliefs, always suspended &#x2013; &#x2018;a willing suspension of disbelief &#x2019; &#x2013; between a punishing Christianity and pure, exhilarating Pantheism. It also reminded me how central the moon is to all his poetry, from <i>The Ancient Mariner </i>to &#x2018;Limbo&#x2019;. <br><br> In looking at objects of Nature while I am thinking, as at yonder Moon dim-glimmering through the dewy window-pane, I seem rather to be seeking, as it were <i>asking</i>, a symbolical language for something within me that already and forever exists ... the dim Awaking of a forgotten or hidden Truth of my inner Nature ... the Creator! the Evolver! <br><br> Back in England, I located the little lost house in Calne, Wiltshire, opposite the churchyard, where he went to ground in 1813, given up by almost all his friends &#x2013; even by Wordsworth &#x2013; as a hopeless opium addict who would achieve nothing. On the hillside above his house I saw the symbolic Cherhill White Horse, carved in the chalk around 1780, galloping towards London, which always gave him hope. Two years later he re-emerged with a draft of his prose master- piece the <i>Biographia Literaria</i>, a fantastic mixture of humorous auto- biography, brilliant psychological criticism, and plagiarised German philosophy. So much of this, like his lectures, is best read in fragments. For instance this inspired lecture note &#x2013; a mere four words &#x2013; summarising the opening of Shakespeare&#x2019;s <i>Hamlet</i>. &#x2018;Suppression prepares for Overflow.&#x2019; I came to think that this contained, or rather anticipated, all Freud. <br><br> Yet some of the most vivid lessons came from his childhood at Ottery St Mary in Devon, which reappears in so many of his best early poems, like the &#x2018;Sonnet to the River Otter&#x2019; and &#x2018;Frost at Midnight&#x2019;. In the sonnet, he explores the infinitely subtle shifts of feeling between the immediate experience of the child and the recollections of the adult. The recreation of this movement remains one of the greatest challenges to biographical narrative. Coleridge succeeds in catching it with wonderful simplicity, using the stone-skimming children&#x2019;s game of ducks and drakes, and the &#x2018;bedded sand&#x2019; of memory: <br><br> What happy and what mournful hours, since last&nbsp;<br> I skimm&#x2019;d the smooth thin stone along thy breast, <br> Numbering its light leaps! yet so deep imprest <br> Sink the sweet scenes of childhood, that mine eyes <br> I never shut amid the sunny ray,&nbsp;<br> But straight with all their tints thy waters rise, <br> Thy crossing plank, thy marge with willows grey, <br> And bedded sand that vein&#x2019;d with various dyes <br> Gleam&#x2019;d through thy bright transparence! <br> &nbsp;<br> Then there was the time as a small boy that he ventured into a deep cave near the banks of the River Otter. This was a haunted place known locally as &#x2018;the Pixies&#x2019; Parlour&#x2019;. Greatly daring, he carved his initials in the stone at the very back. A decade later he returned as a young man, to crawl in again and admire these initials, as he put it, &#x2018;cut by the hand of childhood&#x2019;. After another two decades, now nearly forty, the physical fact had become a metaphysical one. In a poem, &#x2018;A Tombless Epitaph&#x2019; (1809), he compared his crawling into this dark cave with his later exploration of the cave of philosophy. The mineral glitter of this reimagined mental cave, the cave of his own mind and imagination, adds a whole new dimension to the &#x2018;caverns measureless to man&#x2019; of &#x2018;Kubla Khan&#x2019;: <br><br> ... Yes, oft alone,&nbsp;<br> Piercing the long-neglected holy Cave,&nbsp;<br> The haunt obscure of old Philosophy,&nbsp;<br> He bade with lifted torch its starry wall <br> Sparkle, as erst they sparkled to the flame <br> Of odorous lamps tended by Saint and Sage. <br> &nbsp;<br> When I crawled into that same sandstone cave almost exactly two hundred years later, I made a surp...</p><h2>Stephen King Goes to the Movies</h2><p>Stephen King revisits five of his favorite short stories that have been turned into films: <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> (based on the novella "Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption") was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and best actor for Morgan Freeman. <i>1408</i> starred John Cusack and Samuel L.

Rather, she instructed her subjects to dress casually, many times similarly, and coaxed them to accompany her into the backyard, the garden or onto the beach. Once there, she would intuitively find the perfect location and, more importantly, exquisite light, all the while engaging Mother Nature and serendipity to serve as the ultimate stylist. Her long and prolific career built an archive of over five decades of extraordinary documentation of America&#x2019;s most distinguished dynasties&#x2015;with assorted Kennedys, Fords, and the families of style icons Lilly Pulitzer and Este� Lauder included in her inspiring body of work.</p> <p>By choosing to work exclusively in black and white, Kuhner unknowingly created a powerful genre that would not only impact family photography, but also all fine contemporary wedding, portrait, fashion and advertising imagery as we now know it. Today, the black and white &#x201c;environmental portrait&#x201d; is considered the preeminent, highly regarded standard, thanks to one remarkable visionary&#x2015;Betty Kuhner.

In <i>The First Muslim</i>, Lesley Hazleton brings him vibrantly to life. Drawing on early eyewitness sources and on history, politics, religion, and psychology, she renders him as a man in full, in all his complexity and vitality. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hazleton&#x2019;s account follows the arc of Muhammad&#x2019;s rise from powerlessness to power, from anonymity to renown, from insignificance to lasting significance. How did a child shunted to the margins end up revolutionizing his world? How did a merchant come to challenge the established order with a new vision of social justice? How did the pariah hounded out of Mecca turn exile into a new and victorious beginning? How did the outsider become the ultimate insider?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Impeccably researched and thrillingly readable, Hazleton&#x2019;s narrative creates vivid insight into a man navigating between idealism and pragmatism, faith and politics, nonviolence and violence, rejection and acclaim. <i>The First Muslim </i>illuminates not only an immensely significant figure but his lastingly relevant legacy.</p><p>Lesley Hazleton reported on the Middle East from Jerusalem for more than a dozen years, and has written for <i>Time</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, and <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i>, among other publications.

Hazleton lives in Seattle.Part One<br><br>Orphan<br><br>Chapter One<br><br>If he weren&#x2019;t standing lonely vigil on the mountain, you might say<br>that there was no sign of anything unusual about him. The earliest<br>sources describe him with infuriating vagueness for those of us<br>who need images. &#x201c;He was neither tall nor short,&#x201d; they say. &#x201c;Neither<br>dark nor fair.&#x201d; &#x201c;Neither thin nor stout.&#x201d; But here and there, specific<br>details slip through, and when they do, they are surprising. Surely a<br>man spending night after night in solitary meditation would be a<br>gaunt, ascetic figure, yet far from being pale and wan, he had round,<br>rosy cheeks and a ruddy complexion. He was stockily built, almost<br>barrel-chested, which may partly account for his distinctive gait, always<br>&#x201c;leaning forward slightly as though he were hurrying toward something.&#x201d;<br>And he must have had a stiff neck, because people would<br>remember that when he turned to look at you, he turned his whole<br>body instead of just his head. The only sense in which he was conventionally<br>handsome was his profile: the swooping hawk nose long considered<br>a sign of nobility in the Middle East.<br><br>On the surface, you might conclude that he was an average Meccan.<br>At forty years old, the son of a man he had never seen, he had<br>made a far better life for himself than had ever seemed possible.<br>The child born an outsider within his own society had finally won<br>acceptance, and carved out a good life despite the odds against him.<br>He was comfortably off, a happily married business agent with the<br>respect of his peers. If he was not one of the movers and shakers of his<br>prosperous city, that was precisely why people trusted him to represent<br>their interests. They saw him as a man with no axe of his own to<br>grind, a man who would consider an offer or a dispute on its merits<br>and decide accordingly. He had found a secure niche in the world, and<br>had earned every right, in middle age, to sit back and enjoy his rise to<br>respectability. So what was he doing alone up here on one of the<br>mountains that ringed the sleeping city below? Why would a happily<br>married man isolate himself this way, standing in meditation through<br>the night?<br><br>There was a hint, perhaps, in his clothing. By now he could certainly<br>have afforded the elaborate embroidered silks of the wealthy,<br>but his clothing was low-key. His sandals were worn, the leather<br>thongs sun-bleached paler than his skin. His homespun robe would<br>be almost threadbare if it hadn&#x2019;t been so carefully patched, and it was<br>hardly enough to shield him against the night-time cold of the high<br>desert. Yet something about the way he stood on the mountainside<br>made the cold irrelevant. Tilted slightly forward as though leaning<br>into the wind, his stance seemed that of someone who existed at an<br>angle to the earth.<br><br>Certainly a man could see the world in a different way up here. He<br>could find peace in the silence, with just the soughing of the wind over<br>the rock for company, far from the feuds and gossip of the city with its<br>arguments over money and power. Here, a man was merely a speck in<br>the mountain landscape, his mind free to think and reflect, and then<br>finally to stop thinking, stop reflecting, and submit itself to the<br>vastness.<br><br>Look closer and you might detect the shadow of loneliness in the<br>corners of his eyes, something lingering there of the outsider he had<br>once been, as though he were haunted by the awareness that at any<br>moment everything he&#x2019;d worked so long and hard for could be taken<br>away. You might see a hint of that same mix of vulnerability and resoluteness<br>in his mouth, the full lips slightly parted as he whispered into<br>the darkness. And then perhaps you&#x2019;d ask why contentment was not<br>enough. Did the fact that it had been so hard-earned make him unable<br>to accept it as a given, never to be secure in his right to it? But then<br>what would? What was he searching for? Was it a certain peace within<br>himself, perhaps? Or was it something more&#x2014;a glimpse, maybe just<br>an intimation, of something larger?<br><br>One thing is certain: by Muhammad&#x2019;s own account, he was completely<br>unprepared for the enormity of what he would experience on<br>this particular night in the year 610.</p><h2>How To</h2><p><p><b>The world's most entertaining and useless self-help guide, from the brilliant mind behind the wildly popular webcomic xkcd and the million-selling</b><b> <i>What If?</i> and <i>Thing Explainer</i></b></p><p>For any task you might want to do, there's a right way, a wrong way, and a way so monumentally bad that no one would ever try it. <i>How To</i> is a guide to the third kind of approach.

Because she was going to study him, she decided to call him Alex--short for Avian Learning EXperiment. At that time, most scientists thought that the bigger the brain, the smarter the creature; they studied great apes and dolphins. African greys, with their walnut-sized "birdbrains," were pretty much ignored--until Alex.&nbsp;<br><br>His intelligence surprised everyone, including Irene. He learned to count, add, and subtract; to recognize shapes, sizes, and colors; and to speak, and understand, hundreds of words. These were things no other animal could do. Alex wasn't supposed to have the brainpower to do them, either. But he did them anyway.<br><br>Accompanied by Meilo So's stunning illustrations, Alex and Irene's story is one of groundbreaking discoveries about animal intelligence, hard work, and the loving bonds of a unique friendship.</p><p>STEPHANIE SPINNER is the author of many books for young readers, including <i>Damosel, Aliens for Breakfast,</i> and <i>Paddywack.</i> After a distinguished career in children's book publishing, she is now a full-time writer.&nbsp;&#x201c;The bigger the brain, the smarter the creature&#x201d;&#x2014;or so scientists thought until graduate student Irene Pepperberg bought an African Grey parrot from a pet shop.

Divided into five chapters, Spinner&#x2019;s lengthy text uses an accessible, conversational tone to balance the science with the more personal story of Pepperberg&#x2019;s steadfast determination and the deep animal-human bond that developed between the two. So&#x2019;s superb multimedia illustrations on white backgrounds inject vibrancy and personality and place the focus squarely on the book&#x2019;s magnetic subject.

What was the question that haunted you?</p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> I think the question that drove a lot of this book was &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Why not walk 3,000 miles? Why not go find the caribou? Why not make paper mach� animals until all the space in your yard and heart is filled up? These Why Nots are what built the story. First them, and then their partners, the just-plain whys. Okay, there&#x2019;s no reason why Etta can&#x2019;t walk all the way to the ocean one way or another, now we need to figure out why she&#x2019;d want to... It was like a persistent three year old asking why? why? why? I suppose that&#x2019;s a bit of a cheeky answer, because that&#x2019;s, I imagine, how most every story is made, but, still, in this case, that&#x2019;s what happened, my imagination said:</p> <p>Why not have a character walk across Canada?</p> <p>And my brain replied: </p> <p>No real reason why not... now tell me why she would want to...?</p> <p>And so on.</p> <p><strong>Caroline:</strong> This is your debut, and it&#x2019;s an astonishing one. What was it like writing this book? What kind of writer are you? Do you make outlines? Do you have rituals? And do you already have something else you are working on?</p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> Writing this book was very... sporadic. I&#x2019;ve got three other jobs, as a freelance musician, an academic at Bath Spa University and a violin teacher, so the writing of this book took place in all the little gaps and spaces in between other things. Lots of writing on the train! (I&#x2019;m actually writing these answers to you on the train right now... :) ). </p> <p>I don&#x2019;t make outlines, I prefer to start each writing session having no idea what&#x2019;s going to happen next... keeps things interesting for me, and I think the spontaneity allows for a more vibrant, living story. I do have a lot of organising &#x2018;helpers&#x2019; tacked up around my desk and office though. For this book I had a big piece of paper with the names and birthdates of all of Otto&#x2019;s siblings, for example... .</p> <p>Because my writing takes places at all sorts of different times and in all sorts of different places (sound-checks for gigs are another good place to squeeze in a couple hundred words...) I don&#x2019;t have straight-forward writing rituals. (Though I&#x2019;m envious and in awe of authors who do.) I do have a few portable rituals though; listening to music is one of these. If I&#x2019;m having trouble getting my head into the writing space I&#x2019;ve got three or four musicians whose work I know puts me into the right zone; I&#x2019;ll pop on some headphones and sink into writing that way, often.</p> <p>And yes! There is something new I&#x2019;m working on... it&#x2019;s a new novel set in a tiny fishing island outpost off the coast of Newfoundland (which is itself off the eastern coast of Canada). It&#x2019;s got mermaids and sea monsters and a lot of rain in it. I&#x2019;m fairly in love with it at the moment...</p> <p><strong>Caroline:</strong>I love the whole idea of the persistence of love and memory. Otto struggles remembering the war. Russell, his friend can&#x2019;t forget a particular woman. And Etta needs to see the ocean. hoping she can remember to come back. Can you talk a bit about memory and its relationship to the book, please?</p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> In <i>Etta and Otto and Russell and James</i> I wanted to explore memory as it pertains to and shapes our ideas of identity. Our sense of self is built out of these stories we tell ourselves about ourselves in the past, and sometimes these stories and memories can get so heavy that they stand in the way of who we want to be or could be now. Etta needs to rewrite her memories so that they are hers and not overwhelmed by Otto&#x2019;s. Russell needs to let his go so that he can move on and out and away. </p> <p><strong>Caroline:</strong> Etta is 83-years-old and one of the most alive characters I&#x2019;ve read. Tell me how you went about crafting her. </p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> Well, Etta and Otto are both loosely based on my maternal grandparents. My grandpa did come from a farm family of 15 kids and his hair did go white after his trip to the World War Two front, and my grandma did teach in a tiny prairie school. Many of the recipes included are her own as well. Of course much of Etta&#x2019;s character is fiction too; I think she is who I want to be at eighty-three.</p> <p><strong>Caroline:</strong> What&#x2019;s obsessing you now and why?</p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> Sea monsters! Both real and mythical. The giant squid is particularly fascinating; I was recently at a film festival where I got to be in a room with one of the only two people ever to have seen a live one. Ever! He said it was shining gold in colour. Amazing. I love that there are these real life magical things still being discovered and explored.</p> <p><strong>Caroline:</strong> What question didn&#x2019;t I ask that I should have?</p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> Hm... lots of people ask: &#x201c;what actually happened at the end of <i>Etta and Otto and Russell and James</i>.&#x201d; But I believe pretty strongly in Barthes&#x2019; idea of the death of the author (as in, interpretation is the key to truth in art, not authority authority), so I wouldn&#x2019;t have answered anyway. So I guess that&#x2019;s the question I&#x2019;m glad you didn&#x2019;t ask... </p> <p>As for what you should have... maybe what&#x2019;s for lunch? Because I think that&#x2019;s an excellent question and I do not know the answer, but wish I did...</p>Raised in Alberta, Canada, Emma Hooper brought her love of music and literature to the UK, where she received a doctorate in Musico-Literary studies at the University of East-Anglia and currently lectures at Bath Spa University.

These unforgettable images are made from his own circle of acquaintances and family; the settings are their homes and stretches of naturist beaches in France and Northern California. In superb reproductions, Sturges evokes the classical spirit of Old Master paintings and late-nineteenth-century photographic tableaux, while probing concepts of emergent sexuality and psychological intimacy. Radiant Identities is the second volume in Sturges&#39;s ongoing work. Physically and psychically revealing, these deeply felt images are gloriously natural and wonderfully compelling. Elizabeth Beverly&#39;s introductory essay, drawn in part from conversations with Sturges&#39;s subjects, adds a new dimension to the photographs. These personal reflections shed light on the unique collaborative process by which Sturges&#39;s remarkable photographs are made. In the book&#39;s afterword, noted photography critic A.D. Coleman places Sturges in the context of current debates surrounding censorship in the arts, and discusses the themes of innocence and sexuality in the photographs.</p><p>Jock Sturges received a B.A. in Perceptual Psychology and Photography from Marlboro College in Vermont and an M.F.A. from the San Francisco Art Institute. He has exhibited widely in the United States as well as in France and Japan. His photographs are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Biblioth�que Nationale in Paris."Of course there's the curiosity. What do I look like? Sometimes disappointment, sometimes pleasure. But it's not just about me: Jock makes the whole world look remarkable--like heaven. He lets me see my own world in a new way."--the voice of one of Sturges's subjects, from Elizabeth Beverly's introduction <br>"[Sturges's] gelatin silver prints luxuriate in textures of sand, flesh, cloth, tide pools and gentle waves. . . . superbly printed, expressive in their modulations of light and joyful tonalities . . . the high mark of Sturges's work is its naturalness, its gentle attentions to the pleasure that can be found in life."--"The Boston Globe" <br>" . . .

He is widely recognised as the greatest 20th-century writer of humour in the English language. Perhaps best known for the escapades of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, Wodehouse also created the world of Blandings Castle, home to Lord Emsworth and his cherished pig, the Empress of Blandings. His stories include gems concerning the irrepressible and disreputable Ukridge; Psmith, the elegant socialist; the ever-so-slightly-unscrupulous Fifth Earl of Ickenham, better known as Uncle Fred; and those related by Mr Mulliner, the charming raconteur of The Angler&#39;s Rest, and the Oldest Member at the Golf Club. In 1936 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for `having made an outstanding and lasting contribution to the happiness of the world&#39;. He was made a Doctor of Letters by Oxford University in 1939 and in 1975, aged 93, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.

But after several idyllic days of exploring, he's hit with some bad luck. He can't find his way home, and he runs into a hungry alligator who takes a bite out of his canoe. When he pulls up to a remote island, he finds another surprise: a mystery that will reach far into his own past . . . and force him to question the world he's left behind.</p></p><p><p>Jean Craighead George wrote over one hundred books for children and young adults. Her novel <em>Julie of the</em> <em>Wolves</em> won the Newbery Medal in 1973, and she received a 1960 Newbery Honor for <em>My Side of the Mountain</em>. She continued to write acclaimed picture books that celebrate the natural world. Her other books with Wendell Minor include <em>The Wolves Are Back</em>; <em>Luck</em>; <em>Everglades</em>; <em>Arctic Son</em>; <em>Morning, Noon, and Night</em>; and <em>Galapagos George</em>.</p>Combining survival tale, nature study, mystery and legend, Newbery Medalist George (Julie of the Wolves) serves up an ultimately unsatisfying stew. While his parents vacation in Europe, 13-year-old Jack, the narrator, stays on his Uncle Hamp's farm on the St. Mary's River in Georgia. Hamp goes off to help a neighbor for at least a week or two... maybe more, and Jack decides the time is ripe to paddle his homemade canoe to the source of St. Mary's, the great Okefenokee Swamp, and search for the fabled Paradise Island. That Paradise, Jack muses, is a fantasy for most people [but] Uncle Hamp says it's part of a human quest for discovery. When an alligator tears a hole in Jack's canoe, the boy finds himself stranded on a small island, where he becomes acquainted with the wildlife and vegetation, builds himself shelter and forages for food. While George demonstrates her expertise as a naturalist, she relaxes the pacing to such an extent that almost no tension remains in the narrative. Jack, underdeveloped as a character, approaches his adventure with matter-of-fact calm. A puzzle emerges when Jack finds an Airedale that looks just like his own dog, answers to the same name and turns out to belong to another boy, an explorer like Jack, who is revealed to be Jack's identical twin, separated at birth. The factual descriptions of the swamp habitat and the fantastic elements of the plot cancel each other out, collapsing the quasi-mythic underpinnings of this quest for discovery.

Six weeks later he was sent home; ashes in an urn. <br> Soon another letter arrived. "The Gestapo has notified your brothers and me that we are to be deported to the East--whatever that means." Hannelore knew: labor camps, starvation, beatings...How could Mama and her two younger brothers bear that? She made a decision: She would go home and be deported with her family. Despite the horrors she faced in eight labor and concentration camps, Hannelore met and fell in love with a Polish POW named Dick Hillman. <br> Oskar Schindler was their one hope to survive. Schindler had a plan to take eleven hundred Jews to the safety of his new factory in Czechoslovakia. Incredibly both she and Dick were added to his list. But survival was not that simple. Weeks later Hannelore found herself, alone, outside the gates of Auschwitz, pushed toward the smoking crematoria. <br> <i>I Will Plant You a Lilac Tree</i> is the remarkable true story of one young woman's nightmarish coming-of-age. But it is also a story about the surprising possibilities for hope and love in one of history's most brutal times.</p><p><b>Laura Hillman</b> (nee Hannelore Wolff) was born in 1923 in Aurich, Germany, near the North Sea. She was the third of five children born to Karoline and Martin Wolff. Five years after Hitler came to power, Laura was separated from her town and family. The events Laura witnessed in the camps kept her from writing for many years, but she finally set out to write her memoir, facing for the first time the circumstances that led to her survival.<br>Laura now lives in Los Alamitos, California, and devotes her time between talking in high schools and colleges about her experiences and being a docent at the Long Beach Museum of Art.Grade 9 Up&#x2013;In a clear, objective narrative, Hillman (called by her German name, Hannelore, in the book) describes her life from April 1942, as a student at a private school in Berlin, until the German surrender in April 1945 that freed her from a detention camp. After her father's death, she left school and was deported with her mother and brothers to Poland. During her three years of captivity she was moved to several labor and concentration camps. Her inclusion on Oskar Schindler's list led, finally, to her deportation to the Br�nnlitz camp in Czechoslovakia, where Jewish prisoners were treated humanely. At the fourth detention camp&#x2013;Budzyn&#x2013;Hannelore met the man who would become her husband. Her growing love and concern for him; her strong instinct for survival; and her endurance in the face of deprivation, inhumane conditions, and near-starvation provide considerable inspiration. Several photos of family members are included, along with a map that clearly indicates the locations of the camps in which Hannelore was held prisoner. While strong language, descriptions of brutality, a rape scene, and sexual innuendos suggest an audience of mature teens, this readable account of loss and survival during Hitler's Holocaust belongs in most collections.<i>&#x2013;Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The narratives provide vivid portraits of the land as well as the people and animals that inhabited it, ever underscoring the author&#39;s abiding concerns as a naturalist.</p><p>It's no secret that America's most bully president was also its most bully outdoorsman and conservationist; what's often forgotten was how beautifully and authoritatively he wrote about the wilderness and his considerable experiences there. These two pre-White House narratives--<i>Ranchman</i> was originally published in 1885, <i>Wilderness</i> eight years later--are rich and vivid. The former chronicles Roosevelt's sojourns in the Dakota Badlands; the latter is an extended love letter to the pleasures and challenges of outdoor life. So what if some of his 19th-century ideas seem politically incorrect by the standards of the next century--magnificent prose is still magnificent prose. "Nowhere, not even at sea," writes the future First Hunter in one haunting passage, "does a man feel more lonely than when riding over the far-reaching seemingly never-ending plains ... [but] after a man has lived a little while on or near them, their very vastness and loneliness and their melancholy monotony have a strong fascination for him." By comparison, the isolation and weight of the Oval Office must have seemed like an afternoon stroll in the park.These two volumes from 1885 and 1893, respectively, revisit the days when men were men and animals ran for cover.

After twelve years in the French army and eleven as a policeman, he had seen the gruesome effects of artillery shells and machine guns and then of the metal and glass of automobile crashes on the human body. And while he often hoped to forget the impact of a bullet on his own flesh, the sullen ache in his hip with the coming of each winter&#x2019;s damp would remind him of the shot that had sent him tumbling into the snow in the hills above Sarajevo. He&#x2019;d never forget the brightness of the French tricolore on the sleeve of the medic who worked on him until the helicopter came. Any sight of his country&#x2019;s flag now always brought back to Bruno the red of his blood against the white of the snow and the blue helmet he&#x2019;d been wearing as a United Nations peacekeeper.<br><br>But Bruno had never seen anything quite as grim as the sight of the dead man now lying trussed and half-�naked before him. Rain trickled down the corpse&#x2019;s chest and stomach, gleaming on the fresh burn marks where the stubs of his nipples had been. The body was lit by the headlights of Bruno&#x2019;s own van and the large fire engine of St. Denis. Flickering flames on the tires of the car defied the steady rain and the white foam the firemen had used to douse the fire. Breathing through his mouth to avoid the stench of both charred flesh and burning rubber, Bruno checked his watch. Dawn was still an hour away.<br><br>It was not only the smell that turned his stomach. He felt sickened by a personal sense of outrage. Even though the dead man was a stranger, Bruno felt the manner of this man&#x2019;s death had been a kind of pollution of these woods that he loved and knew so well. He&#x2019;d never be able to bring his horse or his dog this way without thinking of it. And this atrocity had been carried out by people skilled in the blackest arts of death, professionals who were notoriously hard to bring to justice. But he&#x2019;d find them.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s certainly dead and it&#x2019;s obviously murder. Did you see the wound under the chin?&#x201d; asked Fabiola, whose presence as a doctor was legally required to certify death. Bruno nodded. A stiletto up through the soft skin of the mouth and straight into the brain killed quickly and with very little blood. It was one of the assassin&#x2019;s tricks taught to troops in special forces.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even give you an approximate time of death,&#x201d; she went on. Bruno&#x2019;s good friend Fabiola wore no hat, and rain had plastered streaks of her dark hair across her face, covering the scar on her left cheek. Without makeup her face was pale in the headlights and her eyes enormous. Bruno was suddenly struck by how beautiful Fabiola could be.<br><br>&#x201c;Normally I&#x2019;d use an anal thermometer for body temperature, but he&#x2019;s been badly sodomized and then the fire . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The ground is dry beneath his hips,&#x201d; said Bruno. &#x201c;The storm broke just after two this morning, so presumably the killers chained him to the tree before then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You were awake for the storm?&#x201d; she asked. He nodded. The lightning had not disturbed him but the quick scuttle of Balzac, his basset hound, into his bed had jolted him awake just as the thunder came. Usually barred from his master&#x2019;s bed, the dog was still young enough to be granted a dispensation during the tempests that occasionally gave this valley of the River V�z�re a brief taste of an Indian monsoon. Bruno had risen, gone to the window and looked out to see if the rain was hard enough to damage the vineyards now that the harvest was due.<br><br>After a lapse into a steady drizzle, the rain was coming harder again, the tail end of a storm front that had swept in from the Atlantic. Once Fabiola had finished her examination, Bruno tried to cover the body with a plastic sheet. It protected the charred bones of the feet and lower legs but didn&#x2019;t stretch as far as the man&#x2019;s wrists, still handcuffed around the trunk of a young chestnut tree. The poor devil would have to stay that way, arms stretched out behind his head, his legs staked apart and his back arched like some medieval torture victim, until the forensics team arrived from P�rigueux with its cameras and checklists.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think he was killed before the fire burned his feet away?&#x201d; Fabiola&#x2019;s voice sounded forced as she tried to control it.<br><br>Bruno shrugged, a gesture that turned into a shudder as he thought about it. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s more your expertise than mine. I don&#x2019;t know how you&#x2019;d tell.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The autopsy will confirm it. After death the heart stops pumping blood.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno suspected the feet had been burned deliberately before the car was set on fire. The blaze might have scorched the legs but it could hardly have devoured them. He guessed the killers had poured gasoline onto his feet.<br><br>The only time Bruno had heard of that being done was in the Algerian War. It was a cruel joke of the rebels, who called the white colonists on their land the pieds-�noirs, the &#x201c;black feet,&#x201d; after the black boots the French troops had worn when they first conquered the country in 1830. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll give you black feet,&#x201d; they taunted the French prisoners as they poured the gasoline. He&#x2019;d been told that by Hercule, an old friend, now dead, who had served in the vicious conflict France had fought in vain to keep Algeria and its oil.<br><br>&#x201c;No identification?&#x201d; Fabiola asked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say North African heritage with that hair and the olive skin.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He has nothing on him, and the registration plates were removed from the car.&#x201d; Bruno had taken the vehicle identification number from the engine block, but he didn&#x2019;t expect any feedback until much later in the day. Fabiola was staring at him, expecting him to say more. &#x201c;All we know is that Serge was getting up for the cows and saw the explosion in the woods. He called the pompiers just after four. You might as well go back to bed, since I&#x2019;m stuck here until the forensics team arrives.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno yawned and stretched. It had been a broken night, his phone ringing with its special emergency tone waking him before midnight. Then he had dozed, expecting to be called again, until the storm had woken his dog. He&#x2019;d dozed again, Balzac tucked in against his shoulder, until Albert had called him to report the fire in the woods. At least the storm had stopped it from spreading. Like most of the rest of southern France, the d�partement had recently issued a forest fire alert after the dry summer.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s too late to go back to bed, and I wouldn&#x2019;t sleep, not thinking about this.&#x201d; Fabiola gestured with her chin at the plastic-�covered corpse. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go back and shower and put some coffee on. Feel free to come and have a cup once you can get away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, but it won&#x2019;t be for a while. I might have to leave the horses to you this morning.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Poor Bruno. Nobody should have to see scenes like this. If you need something to help you sleep . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He smiled his thanks but shook his head. It was thoughts about women and his confused love life that kept him awake some nights, not memories of war and corpses. Fabiola quickly kissed his cheek and then briefly took shelter with the pompiers in the cab of the fire engine to sign the certificate of death before heading home.<br><br>The burned-�out car was on a rough gravel path about a hundred meters from a minor road, just at the entrance to the commune&#x2019;s old garbage dump. It had been closed since the building of the modern d�chetterie, where all refuse had to be sorted into different containers. The dead man lay a few meters from his charred vehicle. The car had been stopped just beyond the entrance to the dump, beside a pile of logs. Bruno raised one end of the topmost log to assess its weight; it was at least fifty kilos. He could lift it, but he couldn&#x2019;t carry it far.<br><br>Four charred logs lay on the gravel path behind and beneath the burned-�out car. Bruno guessed the driver had been lured onto this side road and then found himself unable to reverse because somebody pretty strong had been waiting to toss thick logs behind his wheels. But why had the driver stopped? Bruno walked on up the slope and around a sharp bend, and his flashlight picked out some broken twigs and crushed grass. He saw tire tracks; a second car had been parked here, blocking the way. It could have been waiting, its driver then switching on the headlights to force the oncoming car to stop. Then an accomplice could have used the logs to immobilize it. He&#x2019;d be looking for at least two men, and forensics might get something from the tracks.<br><br>The spread between those marks looked too wide for a car. He went back to his vehicle for a metallic tape measure and recorded a width of one meter thirty in his notebook. He&#x2019;d have to check this against the width of various types of truck when he got back to his office.<br><br>He loosened the hood of his anorak to make room by his ear for his phone and punched in the speed-�dial number for the brigadier, an important official from the Ministry of the Interior who had given him the phone during a previous case. It was supposed to be secure from wiretaps and it rang with a special tone when someone else on the brigadier&#x2019;s private network was calling. That had been the tone that had woken him before midnight. The caller had identified himself only as Rafiq and said he was coming onto Bruno&#x2019;s territory and might need support. He&#x2019;d said he would call again, but hadn&#x2019;t.<br><br>&#x201c;Duty officer,&#x201d; came the voice in Bruno&#x2019;s ear. Bruno identified himself, described the call from Rafiq and reported the death and the evidence of ambush and torture. &#x201c;It may be Rafiq,&#x201d; he said, stooping to protect his notebook from the rain and read out the vehicle identification number. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s Rafiq&#x2019;s car there&#x2019;s no sign of his phone. It could be compromised.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll check and call you back.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno began to give his location and was interrupted.<br><br>&#x201c;We know where you are. With that phone your GPS coordinates come up on my screen. Have any other police officers been alerted?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Commissaire Jalipeau, chief detective for the d�partement,&#x201d; Bruno said. He had pondered calling the gendarmes, but J-J&#x2019;s team had the expertise and the forensics lab. And the call from Rafiq on the special line had made him cautious. Bruno, employed by the town of St. Denis, got on well with the local gendarmes, but J-J, like many detectives of the Police Nationale, tended to see them mainly as traffic cops.<br><br>&#x201c;Good, keep it that way.&#x201d; The duty officer ended the call.<br><br>Bruno trudged back through sodden leaves toward the fire engine. Fabiola&#x2019;s car was already gone, but the pompiers were happy to stay, warm and dry in their cab and drinking coffee from a thermos. Bruno was just finishing the cup they gave him when his phone rang again.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; came the voice of J-J. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just coming into St. Denis. Can you guide us to the place? I can&#x2019;t make this damn GPS work and I don&#x2019;t want to have to ask the gendarmes.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno gave directions and told him to watch for the lights of the fire engine. He went to tell the pompiers they could go home soon, that the police were on their way. Would French policing be any more efficient if they were all one service, he wondered, or at least if they could overcome the traditional rivalries and learn to work together? His phone buzzed again with the special tone, and this time it was the brigadier.</p><h2>The Basic Guide to Dyeing &amp; Painting Fabric</h2><p>Hand-dyed and &#x2013;painted fabrics are extremely popular, and now everyone can own a complete guide to creating these colorful, dynamic, breathtaking and fashionable styles. <p>This exciting new book contains 10 projects, suitable for any skill level, for dyeing and painting quilts, wearables, purses, pillows, and more!

Instead, he&#x2019;s given the opportunity to serve as a clerk to Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black. He and another clerk stumble onto a potentially huge conspiracy aimed at guiding the court&#x2019;s interests, and the cases dealing with the constitutionality of the prison camps created to detain Japanese-Americans seem to play a key part. Then Cash&#x2019;s colleague dies under mysterious circumstances, and the young, idealistic lawyer is determined to get at the truth. His investigation will take him from the office of J.

Including <i>your </i>teen.<br>If this &#x201c;battle&#x201d; talk sounds like a bit of a stretch to you, let me tell you about Rhys. A few summers ago I spoke at a camp. After an evening session, one of the guy counselors, Rhys, asked if we could talk. A clean-cut nineteen-year-old, Rhys was heading into his sophomore year at a well known Christian college. His eyes reflected sadness that I couldn&#x2019;t fathom. He told me he had a lot of nightmares and a lot of guilt. During his senior year of high school, Rhys and his girlfriend, Emily, were fairly typical Christian kids. They were both active in youth group, had pledged to abstain from sex until marriage, and were known in their circles of friends as &#x201c;good kids.&#x201d;<br>But on the night of their senior prom, everything went crazy. Rhys admitted, &#x201c;One thing led to another, and we pretty much did it all that night. Fooling around, drinking, drugs...you name it.&#x201d; Tragically, Emily overdosed on the drugs, went into a coma, and never came out of it. A week later, she died.<br><b><br><br></b>This is an extreme story, yes, but it happened. As I speak to highschool-age students around the country, I hear stories you wouldn&#x2019;t believe.

Many tell me they know a friend or classmate who has abused prescription drugs.<br>Here&#x2019;s the fact that keeps me awake at night: Rhys and Emily could have been anyone&#x2019;s teens. They are from a generation of teens bombarded by lies, hungry for help, and desperate for truth.

Every teen is only one choice away from hurt, addiction, heartbreak, and more.<br>The scary thing with teenagers is that often we don&#x2019;t know exactly what they&#x2019;re thinking or feeling, even when they live under our own roofs! For the past fifteen years, I&#x2019;ve been touring the country, speaking&#x2014;<br>and more important, <i>listening</i>&#x2014;to teens. Some three hundred fifty thousand teens a year check out my Web site, and more than fifty thousand read and respond to my blog. Teens tell me things they often<br>don&#x2019;t share with their parents. That&#x2019;s why I wanted to write this book&#x2014; not to break their confidences, but to give you the inside scoop on what I&#x2019;m hearing so you can help your teen in the battle.<br>In the struggles teens face, they have a common enemy: the devil. And he hates these kids. More specifically, he&#x2019;s <i>your </i>teen&#x2019;s number one enemy. His task is to steal, kill, and destroy (see John 10:10), and he wants to lure your teen away from the truth and lead your teen toward destruction. Sure, movement toward destruction is more evident in some teens than in others. But no teen is immune to spiritual warfare.<br><b><br><br></b><br>So, as a parent, your call is to grab your weapons, jump into the battlefield on your teen&#x2019;s side, and be ready to give it all you&#x2019;ve got.<br>The idea of <i>fighting </i>for your teen might almost scare you off. Hey, you&#x2019;re just trying to pay the electric bill, pick up the kids from soccer practice on time, and serve something for dinner that didn&#x2019;t come from<br>a drive-through.<br>But I won&#x2019;t sugarcoat what&#x2019;s happening in your teen&#x2019;s world. As a parent, you are engaged in one of the greatest fights of your life. It&#x2019;s already on, whether you want it or not. Every day a war is being waged<br>for the soul of your teen. The question isn&#x2019;t, are you at war? The question is, are you equipped to do battle?<br>Here&#x2019;s what the Bible says about it: &#x201c;Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness. <i>Fight the good fight of the faith</i>&#x201d; (1 Timothy 6:11&#x2013;12, emphasis added).<br>&#x201c;Fight the good fight&#x201d;&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the battle you are in. You are called to faithfully fight for what&#x2019;s right. Just as Satan is fighting to steal, kill, and destroy your teen, so you must be a fighter, helping your teen to win!<br><br>Recently a mother talked to me about her teenage son. &#x201c;Jeffrey,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;my son has never smoked pot, checked out porn, or been sexually active. His grades are good, and his friends are well behaved. He loves going to youth group at church and believes God is calling him into pastoral ministry. I am so glad that God has given us our son.&#x201d;<br><br>I congratulated her on the successes of her son and on her parenting skills, then asked, &#x201c;What are you doing each day to ensure that your son continues down this good road?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; she said, looking perplexed.<br><b><br><br></b>&#x201c;What steps have you put into place to safeguard your son from the Enemy?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s going so well&#x2014;I haven&#x2019;t thought about it much.&#x201d;<br>Together we discussed a plan for her to pray daily for her son, to keep speaking truths into his life, and to keep the lines of communication open with him about his personal life. Most important, we talked<br>about ways she could continue to help him grow in a daily and intimate walk with God.<br>That&#x2019;s what the fight looks like in action.<br>It&#x2019;s easy to believe that good parenting means checking off a list of positive accomplishments for a son or daughter:<br><br>&#x221a; My teen is a Christian.<br>&#x221a; My teen regularly attends youth group.<br>&#x221a; My teen dates a Christian (or doesn&#x2019; date at all).<br>&#x221a; My teen doesn&#x2019; watch MTV.<br>&#x221a; My teen ___________________ (has this form of observable good behavior).<br>You may be able to place a check beside any one or all of these statements. But helping your teen through these intense years isn&#x2019; simply about completing a checklist. You need to be looking ahead, adapting and strategizing as the flow of the battle changes, and working to both guide and guard your teen through obstacles to victory. It means approaching parenting on the offense as you work toward a goal, rather than sitting back and waiting for the other side to come at you.<br>Undoubtedly you&#x2019;e heard messages about how to deal with personal struggles, how to climb back up after failing, how to overcome addictions, and the like. But what if, rather than living life on cruise<br>control, you lived life on enemy patrol&#x2014;atching, being prepared, planning, developing a game plan for life, and putting into practice the principles that shape character and truth?<br>This is the idea behind the warning God gives in 1 Peter 5:8: &#x201c;Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.&#x201d;<br>Odd has not created you to simply survive. He has created you to thrive, to experience the abundant life. When it comes to your teen, 1 Peter 5:8 warns that parents must be found with weapon in hand, ready<br>to fight on behalf of their teens. A mom recently said to me, &#x201c;I realized years ago that I can&#x2019;t sit around assuming that my kids are going to naturally come talk to me about all the stuff in their lives. I have to go to them. I have to initiate conversations. I have to look for moments of opportunity to get them<br>talking. Because if I don&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;l probably never know what they&#x2019;re up against out there.&#x201d;<br>That&#x2019;s it! This mother is in the war room every day, plotting against the Enemy of her teen. She&#x2019;s studying the Enemy&#x2019; tactics so she can guide and guard her teen as he moves toward a deeper and more intimate walk with God.<br>The idea of fighting can seem daunting. But my goal in this book isn&#x2019;t to scare you. It&#x2019; to help you see that the fight is real, that you&#x2019;re in it whether you like it or not, and that you can win the war.<br>This is your moment. When God created you, He created you to be the parent your teen needs you to be. God would never have given you the privilege of being a parent if He didn&#x2019; have an awesome plan<br>for you in the process. God has called you to be a fighter&#x2014;and He has given you everything you need to fight and to win for your teen.<br><br><b><br></b>This book will help you go the distance. In the pages ahead, we&#x2019;ll discuss strategies for going on the offense. We&#x2019;ll talk about what it means to study your teen&#x2019; culture so you can live with your eyes wide<br>open&#x2014;eady, armed, and alert. We&#x2019;ll talk about how one of your greatest strategies, prayer, is actually one of the simplest and how the prayer of a righteous parent is an incredibly powerful and effective tool in this fight (see James 5:16). We&#x2019;ll talk about specific issues your teen is facing (issues that definitely were not around when you were a teen), and we&#x2019;ll look at how these issues don&#x2019; need to surprise you or catch you off guard. We&#x2019;ll look at specific, detailed battle plans that include the tools and resources you need. We&#x2019;ll talk about how your role isn&#x2019;t to prop up your teen or ultimately save him or her, but to teach discernment and provide a solid foundation from which your teen can do battle. We&#x2019;ll show you how to provide your teen with armor for fighting and wings for flying. And we&#x2019;ll talk about the incredible privilege you have been given to encourage your teen to live wholeheartedly for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the fighter who is greater than anything this world can throw your teen&#x2019;s way.<br>Right from the get-go, let&#x2019;s take a look at five main fighting positions necessary for being armed and active in this fight. Keep these fighting positions in mind as you move forward to the following chapters.<br><i>The Sweeping Aside Motion<br></i><br>This means, the past is in the past. Helping your teen win the war isn&#x2019;t about questioning what you could have done yesterday. It is about establishing a battle plan for what you are going to do today, tomorrow,<br>and beyond. It&#x2019;s never too late to reach out to your teen, to learn to communicate again, to listen, to speak words of wisdom into your teen&#x2019;s life. Start today.<br><i>The Gritting Your Teeth Gesture<br><br></i>This means, whatever it takes is whatever it takes. There will be times when you will be challenged to move out of your comfort zone. Your goal must be to arm yourself for battle and be ready to do whatever is necessary to guide and guard your teen through these entangling years. Be fearless.<br><i>The Ultimate Power Stance<br><br></i>This means, pray for your teen every day. The Ultimate Power Stance is kneeling. If you are not praying for your teen every day, start now. If you are, keep it up. Prayer is the key to it all. I can&#x2019;t reiterate this<br>enough. Praying for your teen is the single most powerful tool you have in this fight.<br><i>The Open Book Motion<br></i>This means, you are now a student of teen culture. The world moves at an incredibly fast pace today. To keep up with what&#x2019;s up in your teens' world takes time, energy, effort, and motivation. What&#x2019;s current today might not have been current yesterday. From here on out, make it one of your primary ambitions to study and learn about the world your teen lives in.<br><i>The Deep Breath Posture<br><br></i>This means, the battle is a fight of endurance. You develop a realistic strategy for success by taking it one step at a time. Remember, winning the fight is not about doing everything today. It&#x2019;s about being faithful over the long haul.<br>Power for Your Toughest Job<br><br>Parenting is likely the toughest job you will ever have. Don&#x2019; assume that your teen is exempt from any issue discussed in the coming pages. At some point, on some level, every teen will encounter every issue described in this book. As a parent, you need to be equipped. It is my hope that this book will be a powerful resource you use to arm yourself and your teen to win the battle being waged for his or her soul.<br>Remember the Ultimate Power Stance? Let&#x2019; take a moment to pray right now for your teen, for what we&#x2019;l talk about ahead in this book, and for how life may change.<br><br><b>Praying Scripture for Your Teen<br></b><i>Lord, You say in Your Word that if we seek You we&#x2019;l be able to find You. Troubles may come and awful things may happen, but You listen and You care. You&#x2019;e a compassionate God. You will not abandon my family. Please guide me in this fight for my teen. You are God. You are good. Give me Your strength,<br>Your wisdom, and Your perspective. I put my trust in You. Amen.<br></i>BASED ON DEUTERONOMY 4:29</p><h2>Beautiful Light: Religious Meaning in Film</h2><p>Though "religious" films usually don't get much respect in Hollywood, religion still regularly finds its way into the movies. In&nbsp;<i>Beautiful Light</i>&nbsp;Roy Anker seeks out the often unnoticed connections between film and religion and shows how even films that aren't overtly religious or Christian in their content can be filled with deep religious insights and spiritual meaning.<br><br> Closely examining nine critically acclaimed films, including&nbsp;<i>Magnolia, The Apostle, American Gigolo</i>, and M. Night Shyamalan's&nbsp;<i>Wide Awake</i>, Anker analyzes the ways in which these movies explore what it means to be human&#x2014;and what it means, as human beings, to wrestle with a sometimes unwieldy divine presence. Addressing questions of doubt and belief, despair and elation, hatred and love, Anker's work sheds "beautiful light" on some of Hollywood's most profound and memorable films.</p><p>Roy M. Anker teaches literature and film at Calvin College, Grand Rapids, Michigan. His other books include Catching Light: Looking for God in the Movies and the two-volume Self-Help and Popular Religion in American Culture.<b>William D.

His novels include <i>Flight of the Intruder</i>, <i>The Disciple</i>, <i>The Assassin</i>, and the Deep Black and Saucers series. A former naval aviator and Vietnam combat veteran, he is a graduate of West Virginia University and the University of Colorado School of Law. He lives in Colorado.1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Adam Solo wedged himself into the chair at the navigator&#x2019;s table in the small compartment behind the bridge and braced himself against the motion of the ship. Rain beat a tattoo on the roof over his head, and wind moaned around the portholes. Although the seas weren&#x2019;t heavy, the ship rolled, pitched and corkscrewed viciously because she was not under way; she was riding sea anchors, being held in one place, at the mercy of the swells. <br>Through the rain-smeared porthole windows Solo could see the flood and spotlights of another ship several hundred feet to port. She was also small, only 350 feet long, roughly the size of the ship Solo was aboard, <i>Atlantic Queen</i>. She also carried massive cranes fore and aft, was festooned with floodlights that lit the deck and the water between the ships and was bobbing like a cork in a maelstrom. <br>Through the open door to the bridge Solo occasionally heard the ringing of the telegraph as the captain signaled the engine room for power to help hold his ship where he wanted her. Johnson was the captain, an overweight, overbearing slob with a sneer engraved on his face and a curse on his lips. He was cursing tonight as he wrestled the helm; Solo ignored the burst of mindless obscenities that reached him during lulls in the wind&#x2019;s song and concentrated on the newspaper before him. <br>&#x201c;Possible Alien Starship Found in Australia,&#x201d; the headline screamed. Beneath that headline, in slightly smaller type, the subhead read, &#x201c;Wreckage buried in coral reef moved ashore for study.&#x201d; <br>Beside the story was a photo of two men and two women posed in front of a massive pile of unidentifiable junk. Solo studied the wreckage. It was not possible to even determine what the original color might have been. The two men were identified in the caption of the photo as Mr. Rip Cantrell, a young man in his early twenties, and Mr. Arthur &#x201c;Egg&#x201d; Cantrell, a rotund, balding man in his fifties. The woman, lean and athletic with her hair in a ponytail, was identified as Charlotte Pine, a former U.S. Air Force test pilot. Beside her stood an Australian archaeologist. Solo studied their faces in the photo, then read the article as rain pounded on the windows and the ship rode the back of the living sea. <br>The article mentioned that this was not the first spacecraft Rip Cantrell had discovered. About a year before, as a young engineering student on an expedition to the Sahara, Cantrell had uncovered a perfectly preserved saucer in a sandstone ledge and had even figured out how to make it fly. He almost lost his life when greedy thugs tried to steal the saucer and its valuable technology. Only with the help of former test pilot Charley Pine had he managed to save that saucer and keep it safe. Soon after, a Frenchman named pierre Artois, an evil genius bent on world conquest, had even managed to steal the famous Roswell saucer the air force had kept hidden for decades at Area 51. Once again, Charley Pine had saved the day when she chased the Roswell saucer and it crashed into the ocean as millions watched on TV. Since then, saucer technology had been revolutionizing the world economy. Great leaps forward in alternative fuels, antigravity and computer technology, solar power, metal fabrication&#x2014;all these advances in man&#x2019;s knowledge were leading to new products and improvements in old ones. <br>Solo was a trim man with short black hair, even features and skin that appeared deeply tanned. He was below average in height, just five and a half feet tall, and weighed about 140 pounds. Tonight he was dressed in jeans, work boots and a dark green Gore-Tex jacket. <br>He leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes, savoring the movement of the ship. <br>Ah, once, long ago, he had been out on this ocean in winter, in a vessel much smaller than this one. How the wind had howled in the rigging; spindrift showered the men and women huddled under blankets and skins, trying to stay warm, as cold rain stung and soaked them. Occasionally the rain turned to sleet, and the ship and people were soon covered with a layer of ice. <br>The motion of this ship brought the memory flooding back. Most of those nights he spent at the steering oar, because he was the best helmsman aboard and he was the captain. In that roaring, wet, absolute darkness the trick was to keep the wind in the same quadrant, keep the unseen sail drawing evenly, feel the way the ship rode the sea, actually become one with the ship. If he held the wind just so and the motion of the ship remained the same, he was steering a straight course. If the sail luffed or the motion of the ship changed, he would hear and feel it. <br>Without a compass, without the moon or stars, raw seamanship was the only way a course could be sailed. Adam Solo had been good at it then, and after a week of storms and clouds and wind brought them all safely to land. <br>Solo&#x2019;s chin was on his chest when the door opened and a heavyset man wearing a suit and tie came in. He tossed a foul-weather coat on the desk. <br>&#x201c;Doctor,&#x201d; Solo said in greeting. <br>Dr. Harrison Douglas, the chairman and CEO of World Pharmaceuticals, was so nervous he couldn&#x2019;t hold still. &#x201c;This is it, Solo,&#x201d; he said as he smacked one fist into a palm. &#x201c;This flying saucer we are bringing up is the key to wealth and power beyond the wildest dreams of anyone alive.&#x201d; Douglas added, almost as an aside to himself, &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s still reasonably intact&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If it holds the secrets I think it does, then yes.&#x201d; Douglas braced himself and glanced out the porthole at the heaving sea between the ships. &#x201c;You still think you can make the computers talk to you?&#x201d; <br>Solo nodded. &#x201c;Yes, but you&#x2019;ve never told me what you want from them.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. I&#x2019;ve kept my mouth firmly shut.&#x201d; Douglas took a deep breath, looked around the little room, then fastened his gaze on Solo. &#x201c;This saucer crashed into the ocean. May be torn all to hell, smashed into bits, but there&#x2019;s a sliver of a chance&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>Douglas turned to the porthole and rubbed the moisture from the glass with his sleeve. &#x201c;&#x2026; A sliver of a chance that one or more of the computers are intact. And if one is, I want you to find the formulas for any drugs that are in the memories.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Are there formulas for drugs?&#x201d; <br>All the experts agreed that interstellar distances were so vast that a starship crew would die before they got to their destination unless their lives were artificially extended. Somehow. <br>&#x201c;Yes, there are drugs,&#x201d; said Douglas. &#x201c;Enough said. You know our deal. I&#x2019;ll pay you ten million cash.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And make billions.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I sincerely hope so,&#x201d; Harrison Douglas said. He jammed his hands in his pockets and stared out the porthole into the night with unseeing eyes. <br>Yes, he did hope to make billions, and if ever there was a drug to generate that kind of money, a drug that prevented aging was undoubtedly it. Well, Douglas was in the Big Pharma business. If arresting aging involved drugs, by God, World Pharmaceuticals could figure out how to make them. Every man and woman on the planet would like to stop the aging process, or if that proved impossible, at least slow it down, preserve quality of life and extend it free from the diseases that aging causes or enables. An extra ten good years&#x2014;how much would that be worth to the average Joe? Or twenty? Or thirty? America, Europe, Arabia, India, Japan, China&nbsp;&#x2026; the possibilities were awe-inspiring. <br>Harrison Douglas twitched with excitement. <br>Douglas smacked a fist into the palm of his other hand. <i>Yes, the people of the saucers must have possessed an antiaging drug.</i> <br>Douglas was musing on how much money such a drug would make World, and himself, of course, the CEO who made it happen, when he heard Captain Johnson give a shout. <br>Douglas glanced through the porthole. He saw waves washing over a shape even darker than the night sea. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s up!&#x201d; he said excitedly. With that he grabbed the foul-weather coat and dashed through the door onto the bridge. He went straight through, right by the captain, onto the open wing of the bridge and charged down a ladder to the main deck. <br>Adam Solo slowly folded the page of the newspaper that contained the story of the Australian artifact and placed it in his shirt pocket. He pulled on a cap and stepped onto the bridge. Ignoring the captain at the helm, Solo walked to the unprotected wing of the bridge and gazed down into the heaving dark sea as the wind and rain tore at him. The wind threatened to tear his cap from his head, so he removed it. Dr. Douglas was there on the main deck at the rail, holding on with both hands. <br>Floodlights from both ships lit the area between the ships and the heavy cables that disappeared into the water. From the angle of the cables, it was obvious that what they held was just beneath the surface. Snatches of the commands the chief on deck shouted to the winch operators reached Solo. Gazing intently at the scene before him, he ignored them. <br>As Solo watched, swells separated the ships slightly, tightening the cables, and something again broke the surface. It was a mound, dark as the black water; swells broke over it. <br>As quickly as it came into view, the shape disappeared again as the ships rolled toward each other. <br>Over the next five minutes the deck crews aboard both ships tightened their cables inch by inch, lifting the black shape to the surface again, then higher and higher until finally it was free of the water and hung suspended between the ships. The spotlights played upon it, a black, saucer-shaped object, perfectly round and thickest in the middle. It was not small&#x2014;the diameter was about ninety feet&#x2014;and it was heavy; the cables that held it were taut as violin strings, and the ships listed toward it a noticeable amount. <br>Solo stepped back into the sheltered area of the bridge and wiped the rain from his hair with his hand, then settled the cap onto his head as he listened to the voices on the bridge loudspeaker. The deck chiefs of this ship and the other vessel were talking to each other on handheld radios, coordinating their efforts as the saucer was inched over the deck of this ship. The ship&#x2019;s radio picked up the conversation and piped it here so that the captain could listen in and, if he wished, take part in the conversation. <br>A moment later Dr. Douglas came in from the bridge wing, pulling the door shut behind him and brushing water from his coat. <br>&#x201c;Well, we got it up, Doctor,&#x201d; Captain Johnson said heartily. &#x201c;And they said it couldn&#x2019;t be done. Ha! You owe us some serious money.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I will when you have it safely on the dock in Newark,&#x201d; Douglas replied. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get &#x2019;er there, you can bet on that,&#x201d; Johnson said confidently. &#x201c;The company has big money ridin&#x2019; on it. They promised every man in the crew a bonus, including me. Gonna be nice money, and I&#x2019;ll be damn glad to get it.&#x201d; <br>It took twenty minutes for the deck crew to get the dark, ominous ovoid shape deposited onto the waiting timbers on <i>Atlantic Queen</i>&#x2019;s deck and lashed down. The saucer was so large it filled the space between the bridge and the forward crane and protruded over both rails. It seemed to dwarf the ship on which it rode, pushing it deeper into the sea. <br>When the cables that had lifted the saucer from the sea floor had been released, the sea anchors were brought aboard and the ship got under way. Solo felt the ride improve immediately as the screws bit into the dark water. The other ship, which had helped raise the saucer, had already dissolved into the darkness. <br>&#x201c;There you are,&#x201d; Johnson said heartily to Douglas, who had his nose almost against the window, staring at the spaceship. &#x201c;Your flyin&#x2019; saucer&#x2019;s settin&#x2019; like a hen on her nest, safe and sound, and she ain&#x2019;t goin&#x2019; noplace.&#x201d; <br>Douglas flashed a grin and dashed for the ladder to the main deck. <br>Solo went back into the navigator&#x2019;s shack. He emerged seconds later carrying a hard plastic case and descended the bridge wing ladder to the main deck, where the sailors were milling around, inspecting the saucer while they rigged ropes across it and chained the ropes to padeyes in the deck. Several of them were touching the machine&nbsp;&#x2026; and marveling. <br>As Douglas watched, Solo opened his case, took out a wand and adjusted the switches and knobs within, then donned a headset. Carrying the instrument case, he began a careful inspection of the saucer, all of it that he could see from the deck. He even climbed the mast of the forward crane to get a look at the top of it, then returned to the deck. As he walked and climbed around he glanced occasionally at the gauges in his case, but mostly he concentrated on visually inspecting the surface of the ship. He could see no damage whatsoever. <br>Douglas asked him a couple of questions, but Solo didn&#x2019;t answer, so eventually he stopped asking. One by one the tired sailors left the deck, heading for their berths. They had been hard at work for almost twenty hours and were exhausted. <br>Solo crawled under the saucer and lay there studying his instrument. Finally he took off his headset, stowed it back inside the case and closed it. <br>One of the officers squatted down a few feet away. This was the first mate. &#x201c;No radiation?&#x201d; he asked Solo. The sailor was in his early thirties, with unkempt wind-blown hair and acne scars on his face. <br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t seem to be.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Boy, that&#x2019;s amazing.&#x201d; The mate reached and placed his hand on the cold black surface immediately over his head. &#x201c;So this is the one that went straight into the ocean like a bullet from over a hundred thousand feet up,&#x201d; said the mate, whose name was DeVries. &#x201c;Yeah, I heard all about it on TV. Saw all those reruns of the saucers chasin&#x2019; each other over Manhattan. Bet this thing made one hell of a splash when it hit! I didn&#x2019;t figure we&#x2019;d find it in one piece, I can tell you. An impact like that&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>Solo studied the belly of the saucer as the raw sea wind played with his hair. At least here, under the saucer, he was sheltered from the rain. <br>&#x201c;Everything inside is probably torn loose, I figure,&#x201d; DeVries continued, warming to his subject. &#x201c;Scrambled up inside there like a dozen broken eggs. And that crazy Frenchman flying it must still be inside, squashed flat as a road-killed possum. Couldn&#x2019;t nobody live through a smashup like that. He&#x2019;s gotta be as dead as Napoleon Bonaparte and getting pretty ripe, I&#x2019;ll bet. This thing&#x2019;s been in the water a whole month.&#x201d; <br>The first mate turned to Douglas and asked, &#x201c;So, Doctor, how come you&#x2019;re spending all this money raisin&#x2019; this flyin&#x2019; saucer off the ocean floor?&#x201d; <br>Douglas said matter-of-factly, &#x201c;Scientific curiosity.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Eight million bucks is a lot to pay to scratch that itch,&#x201d; DeVries said thoughtfully, a remark Douglas let pass without comment. The salvage operation was going to cost Douglas at least that much. <br>As those two watched, Adam Solo had placed his hand on the hatch handle and held it there. Now, after ten seconds or so, he pulled down on one end of the handle and turned it sideways. The handle rotated and the hatch opened above his head. Water began dripping out. <br>Not much, but some. The saucer had been lying in 250 feet of water; if the integrity of the hull had been broken, seawater under pressure would have filled the interior. This might be leakage from the ship&#x2019;s tank, or merely condensation. Solo wiped a drip off the hatch lip and tasted it. He was relieved&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t saltwater. <br>Now Solo inspected the yawning hole. He stuck the wand inside and studied the panel on his Geiger counter. &#x201c;Background radiation,&#x201d; he told Douglas, who smiled in a self-satisfied way and rubbed his hands together, a gesture that Solo had noticed he used often. <br>Solo turned off the Geiger counter.

When a horse trainer is found dead at a racetrack, the duo's investigation does little to deter the killer at large. Jeopardizing the case are their colleagues at CID headquarters, whose nosing into the nature of Doyle and Acton's after hours relationship threatens to lay bare the most classified information of all. As the murders pile up, Doyle and Acton uncover something far more sinisiter than they could have imagined. Now that they know too much, their partnership could be very brief indeed. . .<br><br>"It's been a long time since I encountered two characters this charming and engaging.

Doyle&#x2019;s gift for reading people makes her invaluable to the veteran inspector, yet she struggles to keep her coveted entry position and build on her meager education by using multisyllabic words she&#x2019;s researched and practiced to enlarge her vocabulary and impress Acton.

Original.</p><p>Newly promoted detective Miles Flint and his partner, Noelle DeRicci, a veteran on the force, have three cases of intergalactic justice on their hands. One woman, a successful attorney on the run; two children kidnapped by ruthless aliens; and three dead victims of an apparent alien vengeance killing have all turned up in Armstrong Dome on the moon. As Flint delves into the cases, he discovers that all involved intergalactic justice disputes and use of the services of Disappearance Inc. to avoid other-world authorities years earlier. Flint and DeRicci are on their own to solve the crimes and mediate the intergalactic jurisdictional disputes, for their superiors are afraid of causing an intergalactic incident. If the two cops can't put it all together, this could be just the beginning of something big. Rusch has created an entertaining blend of mystery and sf, a solid police drama that asks hard questions about what justice between cultures, and even species, really is. <i>Terrence Miltner</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Does the thought of striking up a conversation with a stranger make your stomach do flip-flops? Do you sit nervously through job interviews waiting for the other person to speak? Are you a Nervous Ned? (or Nervous Nellie?) when it comes to networking? Then it&#39;s time you mastered The Fine Art Of Small Talk. With practical advice and conversation cheat sheets, The Fine Art of Small Talk will help you learn to feel more comfortable in any type of situation, from lunch with the boss to a networking event to a cocktail party where you don&#39;t know a soul. Do you dread corporate cocktail parties where you are expected to schmooze with complete strangers? Do job interviews, blind dates or holiday functions make you clam up, searching frantically for things to say? When speaking with someone you ve just met, do you expect him or her to keep the conversation going? Then the THE FINE ART OF SMALL TALK by Debra Fine is for you. This is a collection of concrete steps and tactics one can employ to begin a meaningful conversation with just about anybody in any situation. THE FINE ART OF SMALL TALK teaches you how to: Start a conversation even when you think you have nothing to say Avoid foot-in-mouth disease Prevent awkward pauses Adopt listening skills that will make you a better conversationalist Approach social functions with confidence Feel more at ease at parties, meetings, job interviews and trade shows Turn every conversation into an opportunity for success Make sure your body language is inviting and natural Use icebreakers that work every time Stabilize your shaky knees and dry your sweaty palms Exit conversations with tact and grace Make the most of networking events Mingle with moxie</p><p>Debra Fine is a former engineer, now nationally recognized as a speaker and trainer. Organizations such as Lockheed Martin, Credit Suisse First Boston, First Data Corporation and the GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals along with hundreds of insurance, real estate, legal, financial and health care associations and singles groups regularly host her Small Talk programs.From Library Journal These two books treat similar subjects, but the contrasts are significant. One covers the entire landscape of speaking, whereas the other focuses just on "small talk." The title of Speak from the Heart describes the book's very solid premise. Emmy Award-winning broadcaster and motivational speaker Adubato emphasizes the importance of being genuine as he attempts to cover every conceivable speaking situation, including public speaking, private conversations, group discussions, and listening. He guides readers in the use of eye contact, developing a conversational style, and being comfortable with their message. Despite many charming personal anecdotes and stories drawn from other sources, this book remains a heavy read. Ironically, while Adubato tells us to make a connection with our audience rather than to "cover the material," he does a much better job of covering the material than of connecting. In contrast, Fine fully engages her audience. She involves readers in the discussion and gives lists of lines people can use to start, maintain, or end a conversation. She discusses conversation topics and how to use them and also includes quizzes, throws in a poem, and scatters a few cartoons to break up the text. Originally released as an audiocassette in 1997, this work comes across much like one of her seminars on small talk. The Fine Art of Small Talk does everything that Speak from the Heart says should be done. Adubato's book is best for academic libraries or large public and business libraries. Fine's is a better choice for most public libraries, as well as business libraries. David Leonhardt, Toronto Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc. --Library Journal<br><br>From Publishers Weekly Would-be social butterflies will get encouragement but little inspiration from this not quite scintillating self-help primer. Fine, a conversation consultant, insists that small talk is the necessary overture to deeper communication, the key to generating business leads and dates and a pathway to a richer life in which strangers are magically transformed into acquaintances. She covers such cocktail-party conundrums as how to spot "approachable" interlocutors, how to make introductions, how to butt into an intriguing conversation, resuscitate a flagging one and bail out of a boring one, and how to resist one-uppers, know-it-alls, motormouths and other abusers of talk. Given the ingrained human reluctance to talk to strangers, will, not technique, is the real issue. Much of the book is taken up with motivational pep-talks to get readers to initiate contact (one agonizing exercise suggests "walk through the mall and just say hello to ten people as you pass them"); in a world where everyone feels at a loss for words, Fine argues, saying virtually anything makes one a "hero." Unfortunately, it doesn't necessarily make one a great conversationalist. The heart of Fine's methodology consists of long lists of icebreakers and inviting questions that she instructs readers to memorize and regurgitate as needed to jump-start and sustain conversations, and these read like rather bad small-talk-dull ("How has the internet affected your life?"), stilted ("Do you have a personal motto or creed?") and awkward ("Describe an embarrassing moment you've had."). Tongue-tied readers can benefit from her pointers and exhortation, but one hopes they will think a little harder before they speak.

Does your face immediately flush when you drink alcohol? Does your stomach groan if you are exposed to raw milk or green fava beans? If so, you are probably among the one-third of the world's human population that is sensitive to certain foods due to your genes' interactions with them.<br> Formerly misunderstood as "genetic disorders," many of these sensitivities are now considered to be adaptations that our ancestors evolved in response to the dietary choices and diseases they faced over millennia in particular landscapes. They are liabilities only when we are "out of place," on globalized diets depleted of certain chemicals that triggered adaptive responses in our ancestors.<br> In Why Some Like It Hot, an award-winning natural historian takes us on a culinary odyssey to solve the puzzles posed by "the ghosts of evolution" hidden within every culture and its traditional cuisine. As we travel with Nabhan from Java and Bali to Crete and Sardinia, to Hawaii and Mexico, we learn how various ethnic cuisines formerly protected their traditional consumers from both infectious and nutrition-related diseases. We also bear witness to the tragic consequences of the loss of traditional foods, from adult-onset diabetes running rampant among 100 million indigenous peoples to the historic rise in heart disease among individuals of northern European descent.<br> In this, the most insightful and far-reaching book of his career, Nabhan offers us a view of genes, diets, ethnicity, and place that will forever change the way we understand human health and cultural diversity. This book marks the dawning of evolutionary gastronomy in a way that may save and enrich millions of lives.<br></p><p><br>Gary Paul Nabhan is an internationally-celebrated nature writer, seed saver, conservation biologist and sustainable agriculture activist who has been called &#x201c;the father of the local food movement&#x201d; by Utne Reader, Mother Earth News, Carleton College and Unity College.

Their intimate storytelling reveals the on- and offstage turmoil of the play's birth--a hard-won miracle beset by artistic roadblocks, technical disasters, and disputes both legal and creative.

James's trademark suspense, insightful characterization, and riveting storytelling, <i>The Children of Men</i> is a story of a world with no children and no future. The human race has become infertile, and the last generation to be born is now adult. Civilization itself is crumbling as suicide and despair become commonplace. Oxford historian Theodore Faron, apathetic toward a future without a future, spends most of his time reminiscing. Then he is approached by Julian, a bright, attractive woman who wants him to help get her an audience with his cousin, the powerful Warden of England. She and her band of unlikely revolutionaries may just awaken his desire to live . . . and they may also hold the key to survival for the human race.</p><p>P. D. James is the author of nineteen books, most of which have been filmed and broadcast on television in the United States and other countries. She spent thirty years in various departments of the British Civil Service, including the Police and Criminal Law Departments of Great Britain's Home Office. She has served as a magistrate and as a governor of the BBC. In 2000 she celebrated her eightieth birthday and published her autobiography, <i>Time to Be in Earnest</i>. The recipient of many prizes and honors, she was created Baroness James of Holland Park in 1991. She lives in London and Oxford.<b>BOOK ONEOMEGA<i>January&#x2014;March 2021</i>1</b>Friday 1 January 2021Early this morning, 1 January 2021, three minutes after midnight, the last human being to be born on earth was killed in a pub brawl in a suburb of Buenos Aires, aged twenty-five years two months and twelve days. If the first reports are to be believed, Joseph Ricardo died as he had lived. The distinction, if one can call it that, of being the last human whose birth was officially recorded, unrelated as it was to any personal virtue or talent, had always been difficult for him to handle. And now he is dead. The news was given to us here in Britain on the nine o&#x2019;clock programme of the State Radio Service and I heard it fortuitously. I had settled down to begin this diary of the last half of my life when I noticed the time and thought I might as well catch the headlines to the nine o&#x2019;clock bulletin. Ricardo&#x2019;s death was the last item mentioned, and then only briefly, a couple of sentences delivered without emphasis in the newscaster&#x2019;s carefully non-committal voice. But it seemed to me, hearing it, that it was a small additional justification for beginning the diary today; the first day of a new year and my fiftieth birthday. As a child I had always liked that distinction, despite the inconvenience of having it follow Christmas too quickly so that one present &#x2013; it never seemed notably superior to the one I would in any case have received &#x2013; had to do for both celebrations.As I begin writing, the three events, the New Year, my fiftieth birthday, Ricardo&#x2019;s death, hardly justify sullying the first pages of this new loose-leaf notebook. But I shall continue, one small additional defence against personal accidie. If there is nothing to record, I shall record the nothingness and then if, and when, I reach old age &#x2013; as most of us can expect to, we have become experts at prolonging life &#x2013; I shall open one of my tins of hoarded matches and light my small personal bonfire of vanities. I have no intention of leaving the diary as a record of one man&#x2019;s last years. Even in my most egotistical moods I am not as self-deceiving as that. What possible interest can there be in the journal of Theodore Faron, Doctor of Philosophy, Fellow of Merton College in the University of Oxford, historian of the Victorian age, divorced, childless, solitary, whose only claim to notice is that he is cousin to Xan Lyppiatt, the dictator and Warden of England. No additional personal record is, in any case, necessary. All over the world nation states are preparing to store their testimony for the posterity which we can still occasionally convince ourselves may follow us, those creatures from another planet who may land on this green wilderness and ask what kind of sentient life once inhabited it. We are storing our books and manuscripts, the great paintings, the musical scores and instruments, the artefacts. The world&#x2019;s greatest libraries will in forty years&#x2019; time at most be darkened and sealed. The buildings, those that are still standing, will speak for themselves. The soft stone of Oxford is unlikely to survive more than a couple of centuries. Already the University is arguing about whether it is worth refacing the crumbling Sheldonian. But I like to think of those mythical creatures landing in St. Peter&#x2019;s Square and entering the great Basilica, silent and echoing under the centuries of dust. Will they realize that this was once the greatest of man&#x2019;s temples to one of his many gods? Will they be curious about his nature, this deity who was worshipped with such pomp and splendour, intrigued by the mystery of his symbol, at once so simple, the two crossed sticks, ubiquitous in nature, yet laden with gold, gloriously jewelled and adorned? Or will their values and their thought processes be so alien to ours that nothing of awe or wonder will be able to touch them? But despite the discovery &#x2013; in 1997 was it? &#x2013; of a planet which the astronomers told us could support life, few of us really believe that they will come. They must be there. It is surely unreasonable to credit that only one small star in the immensity of the universe is capable of developing and supporting intelligent life. But we shall not get to them and they will not come to us.Twenty years ago, when the world was already half convinced that our species had lost for ever the power to reproduce, the search to find the last-known human birth became a universal obsession, elevated to a matter of national pride, an international contest as ultimately pointless as it was fierce and acrimonious. To qualify the birth had to be officially notified, the date and precise time recorded. This effectively excluded a high proportion of the human race where the day but not the hour was known, and it was accepted, but not emphasized, that the result could never be conclusive. Almost certainly in some remote jungle, in some primitive hut, the last human being had slipped largely unnoticed into an unregarding world. But after months of checking and re-checking, Joseph Ricardo, of mixed race, born illegitimately in a Buenos Aires hospital at two minutes past three Western time on 19 October 1995, had been officially recognized. Once the result was proclaimed, he was left to exploit his celebrity as best he could while the world, as if suddenly aware of the futility of the exercise, turned its attention elsewhere. And now he is dead and I doubt whether any country will be eager to drag the other candidates from oblivion.We are outraged and demoralized less by the impending end of our species, less even by our inability to prevent it, than by our failure to discover the cause. Western science and Western medicine haven&#x2019;t prepared us for the magnitude and humiliation of this ultimate failure. There have been many diseases which have been difficult to diagnose or cure and one which almost depopulated two continents before it spent itself. But we have always in the end been able to explain why. We have given names to the viruses and germs which, even today, take possession of us, much to our chagrin since it seems a personal affront that they should still assail us, like old enemies who keep up the skirmish and bring down the occasional victim when their victory is assured. Western science has been our god. In the variety of its power it has preserved, comforted, healed, warmed, fed and entertained us and we have felt free to criticize and occasionally reject it as men have always rejected their gods, but in the knowledge that despite our apostasy, this deity, our creature and our slave, would still provide for us; the anaesthetic for the pain, the spare heart, the new lung, the antibiotic, the moving wheels and the moving pictures. The light will always come on when we press the switch and if it doesn&#x2019;t we can find out why. Science was never a subject I was at home with. I understood little of it at school and I understand little more now that I&#x2019;m fifty. Yet it has been my god too, even if its achievements are incomprehensible to me, and I share the universal disillusionment of those whose god has died. I can clearly remember the confident words of one biologist spoken when it had finally become apparent that nowhere in the whole world was there a pregnant woman: &#x201c;It may take us some time to discover the cause of this apparent universal infertility.&#x201d; We have had twenty-five years and we no longer even expect to succeed. Like a lecherous stud suddenly stricken with impotence, we are humiliated at the very heart of our faith in ourselves. For all our knowledge, our intelligence, our power, we can no longer do what the animals do without thought. No wonder we both worship and resent them.</p><h2>Sherwood Nation: a novel</h2><p>Chosen for the 2016 Silicon Valley Reads program.<br><br><i>It was morning and the power was not yet on.

He lives in Portland with the artist Laura Moulton and their two kids. He blogs at levinofearth.com.Preface<br><br>How it happened:<br>It happened slowly. The fishermen called the rogue and unpredictable changes at sea El Pescadoro. Winds came from differing directions, currents looped back on themselves, temperatures fluctuated. It wasn&#x2019;t seasonal like El Ni�o, though at first everyone thought it was. It didn&#x2019;t go away. Governments fought bitterly about whose fault was whose, and who ought to do what about it.<br>Along with El Pescadero came an increase in oceanic salinity. There were lots of theories there. When you swam in the ocean, the new buoyancy was subtle, but pleasurable.<br>The bone-dry summers of the west lingered deeper and deeper into winter. Everyone could see that the snow pack was melting. When was the snow pack not melting? All you had to do was look up at any of the balding mountains.<br>Then the great Deschutes River, elegant and fast, a river which cut across the Oregon desert like a streak of lightning across a dull gray sky, dried up in a single summer.<br>The farms that depended upon it followed suit. There were strikes and protests. Blood was spilled. Then, quickly, other rivers diminished.<br>Finally, the greatest of them all, the Columbia River, its sources choked in mud, leaked its deathsong through the gorge, and became only a scaly alligator skin of memory. In its wake, valleys turned to deserts, fertile farms to dust, and the great migration East began.<br>As the hordes of Droudies poured into the Midwest and Eastern United States and the last of the surface water seeped deep into the ground, anger over the millions of incoming refugees escalated. Finally, borders along the Rocky Mountains were sealed to Westerners and a meager aid strategy was conceived by the bankrupt government for the many millions abandoned to their dry fates out west.<br>The Drought<br>It was morning and the power was not yet on. Zach and Renee lay in the heat of the bed listening to the city wake outside the building&#x2019;s windows.<br> We should learn how to rain-dance,&#x201d; Renee said. They were new to the relationship, and she could feel his hesitance to speak, the tentativeness to him, like she were some toothy, unpredictable animal he&#x2019;d invited into his house. She pressed her lips into his shoulder and wanted to bite him there. His skin left a taste of salt on her lips.<br> Why don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Zach said.<br> Nah.&#x201d;<br>Zach stared at the ceiling, and she stared at him, with his short-cropped head and monkish demeanor, as if he lived his life in servitude to some greater thing, the identity of which she had yet to figure out. I&#x2019;m thinking of turning to crime instead.&#x201d;<br> You&#x2019;d be good at it,&#x201d; he said. He was never sure how serious she was. He made two pistols of his hands and pow-pow&#x2019;ed the ceiling. But you&#x2019;d need a mask and a horse, obviously.&#x201d;<br> Mm, spurs.&#x201d;<br>An eerie clop clop clop sounded through the open window and they looked at each other in amazement.<br> A horse!&#x201d; she said. You&#x2019;re a conjurer!&#x201d;<br>But instead it was a big moose that stumbled along the dusty street, its skin tight over its ribs. Its head jerked left and right in anxious, almost animatronic movements.<br> Oh no,&#x201d; Renee said, I fucking hate this. Josh saw a bear two days ago I told you?&#x201d;<br>They watched it continue down the street until a shot rang out. The moose&#x2019;s body jerked and sidestepped strangely and then there was another shot.<br> That&#x2019;s a whole shit ton of extra food rations if they can store it,&#x201d; Zach said as they watched men close in on it. God knows how they&#x2019;ll store it.&#x201d; The moose stumbled again on a third shot but continued on. They&#x2019;ve got to get a straight shot in.&#x201d;<br> I can&#x2019;t watch,&#x201d; Renee said. She climbed back in bed and spoke to Zach&#x2019;s shirtless back as he watched the moose fall and the hunters try to drag the animal to the side of the road. Hunters in the streets.&#x201d;<br> Dying of thirst has got to be worse,&#x201d; Zach said.<br> What&#x2019;s happening? Tell me what&#x2019;s happening.&#x201d;<br> They can&#x2019;t lift it, one of its legs is kicking.&#x201d;<br> My co-worker had to kill his dog,&#x201d; Zach said. He&#x2019;s a total mess about it.&#x201d;<br> Seriously? No.&#x201d;<br> He was a big dog. He drank over twenty units a day and was getting aggressive about his share.&#x201d;<br> I don&#x2019;t buy it,&#x201d; Renee said. The moose maybe, but not your own dog. Next is your neighbor, then your children and your wife. It&#x2019;s like a spider that cuts her own webbing.&#x201d;<br> You think I&#x2019;m in danger, as his co-worker?&#x201d;<br> Oh, you&#x2019;re in danger alright.&#x201d;<br>Zach turned and looked at her and she winked at him. She was naked with the sheet pulled to the top of her thighs. She had unraveled her braids for him the night before, and her hair spilled across her arms and his pillow.<br> You&#x2019;re not watching anymore?&#x201d; she said.<br> No.&#x201d; He pulled his gallon off the dresser and poured them each a unit, a little less than half a cup. He handed her one and sat on the edge of the bed, placing one hand on her thigh, the heat of it warming his hand through the sheet. He stared into the shallow cup of water and thought of the moose&#x2019;s stutter-step as it was shot, and wondered if he would know when he was the moose the animal too lost and thirsty for reason, stumbling toward annihilation.<br>He was still thirsty after he&#x2019;d finished. Renee stared into her cup as if awaiting a divination there. It was an effort not to refill his. Rations were two unit gallons per day. His measure of making it: if at the end of the day he had a few units of savings leftover.<br>He watched her sit up in bed. She divvied her hair into two halves and proceeded to re-work each half into long, black braids. He was so taken with her. He wished the job of braiding would never end, so he could keep on watching.<br> Come back in here,&#x201d; she said when she&#x2019;d finished.<br> I&#x2019;ve got to work,&#x201d; he said, but made no movement toward it. He was one of the few people he knew who had a job.<br> Nah. When the power goes on, we can pretend then. We can go about the day. Until then, let&#x2019;s be here.&#x201d;<br>He stood over the bed indecisively for a moment until she got a crab-claw hold on his wrist and pulled him back in. There was a struggle with the sheet as she worked at getting it flattened out and re-positioned over them just so and he held still and grinned as she worried it. When it was finally to her liking, they lay side by side, the sheet pulled to their chins, and were quiet.<br>He found her hand under the covers. Next to him was the girl who&#x2019;d served him coffee at the caf� down the block for over a year, the one he&#x2019;d thought about at work, at night, in bed. The one he never got it together enough to approach for more than a cup of coffee. The girl he&#x2019;d listened to as she talked to customers, weaving in eloquent yarns that inevitably turned to history: the collapse of the Bronze Age, the Mongol empire, the Polish peasant revolt, the Mayan uprising against the Spanish, and with each story he overheard he felt himself able to say less to her, his tongue tangled with awe.<br>Then two weeks ago the caf� was shut down and she walked home with him on her last day. At his door, he&#x2019;d said, I&#x2019;d like it if you&#x2019;d come inside.&#x201d; He still winced at the blunt, sad honesty of the line. She&#x2019;d smiled as if it were really that easy and said sure.<br>She unfolded the corner of the sheet and reached to the bedside table next to her. I have wet wipes!&#x201d; she said. She handed him one and took one for herself. Then she submerged under the sheet with it, and he could feel the wet, cleansing and titillating trail she made with it down his chest, and then further. He reached for any part of her, first the back of her neck, then her arm, later her thigh when that surfaced from under the sheet, and then between.<br>When they finished she squeezed his hand tight and they were silent. After a while she said, We&#x2019;re going to do a robbery. Josh and I and a couple others.&#x201d;<br> Black Bloc Josh? From the re-zoning riot?&#x201d; he said. He let go of her hand and crossed his arms over his chest. Josh had been a regular at the caf�, who with a few others had held regular meetings in which they bitched over-much about the state of the world, with no small amount of bravado. He sat near them once, listening in, watching Renee among the group. They all seemed hardened. Two men and two women, dirty and browned by sun, lean and fierce-looking. In his mind they were like a tribe of warriors; the men were real men and next to them, Zach felt like a boy. He wasn&#x2019;t sure what they&#x2019;d been before: wilderness guides maybe, or labor organizers, or electricians. They certainly hadn&#x2019;t been ad-writers. If he were to be honest, he realized he&#x2019;d hoped never to hear of them again.<br> A truck,&#x201d; she said. We won&#x2019;t take a lot it&#x2019;s a message.&#x201d;<br> Renee please,&#x201d; he turned and propped himself up on one elbow. A message?&#x201d; It was hard to keep the disdain out of his voice.<br> It&#x2019;s not an official distribution truck. They&#x2019;re driving them up into the West Hills and we followed one. We want people to know what they&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d;<br> I can help you guys send a message. Patel &amp; Grummus is the city&#x2019;s ad firm. I talk to the mayor all the time.&#x201d;<br>Renee shrugged and smiled and then pulled him to her. Don&#x2019;t worry, Zach.&#x201d;<br>With his lips pressed against her neck, their bodies fitting together like two hands clasped, he did just that: worry.<br>At the doorway to his building, she kissed him goodbye. It was an easy thing, a simple thing. Like husband and wife do, each headed off for their jobs. Him to his, her to the meeting of the water activists.&nbsp;<br> Listen, don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Zach said once more.<br> I&#x2019;ll bring you a gallon,&#x201d; she said.<br> I don&#x2019;t care about that.&#x201d;<br>She smiled roguishly and patted his cheek. Don&#x2019;t you worry about me. I&#x2019;m invincible,&#x201d; she said and flexed her bicep for him. Go ahead, feel it.&#x201d;<br>He did so and nodded glumly. Impressive. Back in one piece,&#x201d; he said, or else.&#x201d;<br>On her bike, though, she felt vulnerable. She rode hard to her apartment. The streets had begun to be unpredictable moose, yes, but the desperation had led to a steady uptick of violence. She asked herself if she were really going to go through with this, and each time some inner voice, of some stronger substance, piped up that she was.&nbsp;<br>A few weeks previously she and Josh had tailed the trucks heading into the wealthy West Hills neighborhood. They&#x2019;d watched as the trucks pulled into the driveways of palatial houses. Drivers hand-delivering gallon after gallon of water. Inside, she&#x2019;d imagined an opulent matron bathing in a fountain. The image of it needled her for days.&nbsp;<br>Nearly a year ago, when the tap dried up and water service ceased, the city council created the Portland Water Act, declaring water to be a city-owned resource of which every citizen would get equal distribution. But as far as she could tell, while the rich swam in their fountains, kids in Northeast Portland wandered about in a dehydrated daze, the last of the city&#x2019;s trees died, and moose committed suicide.&nbsp;<br>Bea was asleep. She edged her roommate&#x2019;s door open and stared in, trying to decide whether to tell her where she was going. Bea looked peaceful in sleep, issuing a soft snore, a sort of gorilla-hum. Her brownish-red hair curled in a knotted mass around her face and her big feet hung over the end of the bed, uncovered. Though it was warm enough, Renee slipped in and quietly tucked the sheet over them.<br>In her room Renee sat on her bed and rotated her metal unit gallon in her hands...</p><h2>Raised Bed Gardening With Great Results: A book on plant rotation, soil, irrigation, designs, ideas and for growing vegetables in the home garden</h2><p>Raised bed gardening is not new but its popularity has taken a turn as many gardeners are experiencing excellent results.

While many homeschooling authors hem and haw that learning at home isn't for everyone, this manifesto practically tells kids they're losers if they do otherwise. With the exception of a forwarding note to parents, this book is written entirely for teenagers, and the first 75 pages explain why school is a waste of time. Grace Llewellyn insists that people learn better when they are self-motivated and not confined by school walls. Instead of homeschooling, which connotes setting up a school at home, Llewellyn prefers "unschooling," a learning method with no structure or formal curriculum. There are tips here you won't hear from a school guidance counselor. Llewellyn urges kids to take a vacation--at least for a week--after quitting school to purge its influence. "Throw darts at a picture of your school" or "Make a bonfire of old worksheets," she advises. She spends an entire chapter on the gentle art of persuading parents that this is a good idea. Then she gets serious. Llewellyn urges teens to turn off the TV, get outside, and turn to their local libraries, museums, the Internet, and other resources for information. She devotes many chapters to books and suggestions for teaching yourself science, math, social sciences, English, foreign languages, and the arts. She also includes advice on jobs and getting into college, assuring teens that, contrary to what they've been told in school, they won't be flipping burgers for the rest of their days if they drop out.<p> Llewellyn is a former middle-school English teacher, and she knows her audience well. Her formula for making the transition from traditional school to unschooling is accompanied by quotes on freedom and free thought from radical thinkers such as Steve Biko and Ralph Waldo Emerson. And Llewellyn is not above using slang. She capitalizes words to add emphasis, as in the "Mainstream American Suburbia-Think" she blames most schools for perpetuating. Some of her attempts to appeal to young minds ring a bit corny. She weaves through several chapters an allegory about a baby whose enthusiasm is squashed by a sterile, unnatural environment, and tells readers to "learn to be a human bean and not a mashed potato."

But today's readers are often confused when they encounter the myriad names of those deities and try to understand their roles in mythology. This entertaining and mind-expanding book charts 100 of the most prominent characters from Greco-Roman mythology, including the primordial deities, the great gods of Olympus, and the shadowy inhabitants of Hades.

Author Malcolm Day profiles each god with a short, very readable summary of that personage's acts. He sets each deity's story within the larger context of a "family tree" that encompasses all major gods.

Endowed with English royal blood on her mother's side, she was betrothed in infancy to Arthur, Prince of Wales, eldest son of Henry VII of England, an alliance that greatly benefited both sides. Yet Arthur died weeks after their marriage in 1501, and Catherine found herself remarried to his younger brother, soon to become Henry VIII. The history of England-and indeed of Europe-was forever altered by their union.</p><p>Drawing on his deep knowledge of both Spain and England, Giles Tremlett has produced the first full biography in more than four decades of the tenacious woman whose marriage to Henry VIII lasted twice as long (twenty-four years) as his five other marriages combined. Her refusal to divorce him put her at the center of one of history's greatest power struggles, one that has resonated down through the centuries- Henry's break away from the Catholic Church as, bereft of a son, he attempted to annul his marriage to Catherine and wed Anne Boleyn. Catherine's daughter, Mary, would controversially inherit Henry's throne; briefly and bloodily, she returned England to the Catholicism of her mother's native Spain, foreshadowing the Spanish Armada some three decades later.</p><p>From Catherine's peripatetic childhood at the glittering court of Ferdinand and Isabella to the battlefield at Flodden, where she, in Henry's absence abroad, led the English forces to victory against Scotland to her determination to remain queen and her last years in almost monastic isolation, Giles Tremlett vividly re-creates the life of a giant figure in the sixteenth century. <i>Catherine of Aragon</i> will take its place among the best of Tudor biography.</p></p><p><p><b>Giles Tremlett </b>is the Guardian's Madrid correspondent. He has lived in, and written about, Spain for the past twenty years, and is the author of<i> Ghosts of Spain: Travels Through Spain and Its Silent Past</i>.</p>Born to Spain's powerful King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, Catherine of Aragon (1485&#x2013;1536) gave credibility to the rising Tudor monarchy into which she married. Guardian Madrid correspondent Tremlett (Ghosts of Spain: Travels Through Spain and Its Silent Past) eloquently fleshes out the 20-year reign of young Henry VIII's gracious, educated first wife, who intrepidly influenced foreign policy and, as regent, routed the Scots at Flodden Field while Henry less successfully led his army in France. Tremlett clearly favors his Catholic subject, giving her too much credit as the driving force behind opposition to the English Reformation. Still, his portrait of the often overlooked Catherine, who arrived as Henry was elevating his court to a glittering level, as England became firmly established as a European power--a position undermined by the "Great Divorce" from Catherine and the resulting alliance shifts. Tremlett's well-researched portrayal reads easily, and while recognizing Catherine's flaws, he restores the luster to a popular queen whose image was later reduced to a piously dour castoff. Tudor-era fans as well as scholars will appreciate this account. 16 pages of color illus. (Dec.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Even a casual page-through revealed a number of things many adults probably don't know. <i>How Things Work</i> would be a great book for parents who don't want to look like idiots in front of their own children when asked a question they don't know the answer to. It's filled with fun experiments, clear directions, and does a splendid job of simplifying and clarifying elaborate technological concepts.Grade 4-8?Ardley's book combines scientific explanations with over 80 experiments. Six chapters cover the basics of machines, construction and buildings, household appliances, transportation, leisure items, and information technology. Each chapter features several double-page spreads that introduce such topics as "walls and floors" or "weighing machines," usually followed by one or two activities. Captioned, full-color photographs and diagrams provide examples or additional information. In a few cases?"dams" and "combustion engines," for example?the concept is explained through captioned photos that show a child enacting an experiment. The author's weaving of history, narrative explanation, and projects is generally successful, giving children a solid context for the activities and showing how various areas of science apply to the everyday world. The majority of the experiments include an adult help advisory, and some require materials most kids will have to purchase or borrow. On the other hand, many are easy enough for youngsters to manage on their own with common household items, and the variety and quantity insure that most readers will be able to find several that are intriguing and accessible. An attractive layout, with white backgrounds and plenty of color, adds to the book's appeal, but at times the pages are crowded.?Steven Engelfried, West Linn Public Library, OR<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Flicker</h2><p>A novel of suspense involving tangled conspiracies and dark obsessions in the mysterious film industry from the author of the highly acclaimed The Making of a Counterculture.

Roszak died in July 2011.<br>This latest effort by the author of the seminal The Making of the Counterculture is a quirky, sexy, sprawling novel that comprises, among other things, a magical mystery tour of the history of cinema, an acid satire on Hollywood and what passes for today's cultural avant-garde, a metaphysical puzzle, an exploration of the psychological impact of films and a parable about the modern spiritual wasteland. UCLA film scholar and critic Jonathan Gates becomes obsessed with legendary German expressionist filmmaker Max Castle, who went to Hollywood in the mid-1920s and whose vampire and ghoul B-movies are viewed by cult fans as deeply troubling evocations of evil. On the trail of Castle's dark past, Gates and his ex-girlfriend, tough-minded film critic Clare Swann, encounter medieval gnostic heresies, secret societies, a teenage genius albino movie producer and an aged Dutch ex-vamp who practices tantric-like sex. Crammed with film lore that will regale cinema buffs, the narrative segues from its realistic beginning into a bizarre, apocalyptic fantasy that eventually spins off the reel, illuminating in the end only a very private, muddled vision. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>How to Cope When You Are Surrounded by Idiots...

By unfolding the histories of the meaningful objects in their family home in Haworth, Lutz immerses readers in a nuanced re-creation of the sisters' daily lives while moving us chronologically forward through the major biographical events: the death of their mother and two sisters, the imaginary kingdoms of their childhood writing, their time as governesses, and their determined efforts to make a mark on the literary world.</p><p>From the miniature books they made as children to the blackthorn walking sticks they carried on solitary hikes on the moors, each personal possession opens a window onto the sisters' world, their beloved fiction, and the Victorian era. A description of the brass collar worn by Emily&#x2019;s bull mastiff, Keeper, leads to a series of entertaining anecdotes about the influence of the family&#x2019;s dogs on their writing and about the relationship of Victorians to their pets in general. The sisters' portable writing desks prove to have played a crucial role in their writing lives: it was Charlotte's snooping in Emily&#x2019;s desk that led to the sisters' first publication in print, followed later by the publication of <em>Jane Eyre</em> and <em>Wuthering Heights</em>.</p><p>Charlotte's letters provide insight into her relationships, both innocent and illicit, including her relationship with the older professor to whom she wrote passionately. And the bracelet Charlotte had made of Anne and Emily's intertwined hair bears witness to her profound grief after their deaths.</p><p>Lutz captivatingly shows the Bront�s anew by bringing us deep inside the physical world in which they lived and from which their writings took inspiration.</p> 8 pages of color illustrations</p><p>Deborah Lutz&#39;s books include Pleasure Bound: Victorian Sex Rebels and the New Eroticism and Relics of Death in Victorian Literature and Culture.

Walesa creates a vision of centuries of hopeless oppression, pover ty, hunger, inhumanity, vacuous leader ship, endless petty bickering, and jeal ous betrayals within the Polish society until a series of events united them. Wa lesa, with the simple prose of one who has the clarity of vision, purpose, and reason needed to express the tyrannical treatment of his people by the Russian puppet government, wins for them the concessions without theories or point less rebellions. James Michener's Po land (Random, 1983) gives good histori cal background on the obstacles Walesa has overcome and supports Walesa's au thoritative and accurate record of the leading historical figures involved. This is a classic story of one man's leadership against overwhelming tyranny. It is an easily read, inspiring autobiographical chronicle that will continue to be a valu able addition to young adult collections for years to come.

No heat, no smoke, but still the forests burned, crowning with red and yellow and orange; a cold conflagration with the coming of fall, and the leaves resignedly descending. There was mortality in the air, borne on the first hint of winter breezes, the threatening chill of them, and the animals prepared for the coming snows. The foraging had begun, the filling of bellies for leaner times. Hunger would make the more vulnerable creatures take risks in order to feed, and the predators would be waiting. Black spiders squatted at the corners of their webs, not yet slumbering. There were still stray insects to be had, and further trophies to be added to their collections of withered husks. Winter coats grew thick, and fur began to lighten, the better to blend in against the snow. Contrails of geese arrowed the skies like refugees fleeing a coming conflict, abandoning those forced to stay and face what was to come. </p><p>The ravens were motionless. Many of their far-northern brethren had headed south to escape the worst of the winter, but not these birds. They were huge yet sleek, their eyes bright with an alien intelligence. Some on this remote road had noticed them already, and if they had company on their walks, or in their automobiles, they commented on the presence of the birds. Yes, it was agreed, they were larger than the usual ravens, and perhaps, too, they brought with them a sense of discomfort, these hunched beings, these patient, treacherous scouts. They were perched deep among the branches of an ancient oak, an organism approaching the end of its days, its leaves falling earlier each year, so that by the end of every September it was already bare, a charred thing amid the flames, as though the all-consuming fire had already had its way with it, leaving behind only the smoke smudges of long-abandoned nests. The tree stood at the edge of a small copse that jutted slightly at this place to follow the curvature of the road, with the oak as its farthest point. Once there were others like it, but the men who built the road had cut them down many years before. It was now alone of its kind, and soon it too would be gone. </p><p>But the ravens had come to it, for the ravens liked dying things. </p><p>The smaller birds fled their company, and regarded the intruders warily from the cover of evergreen foliage. They had silenced the woods behind them. They radiated threat: the stillness of them, their claws curled upon the branches, the bladelike sharpness of their beaks. They were stalkers, watchers, waiting for the hunt to begin. The ravens were so statuesque, so immobile, that they might have been mistaken for misshapen outcroppings of the tree itself, tumorous growths upon its bark. It was unusual to see so many together, for ravens are not social birds; a pair, yes, but not six, not like this, not without food in sight. </p><p>Walk on, walk on. Leave them behind, but not before casting one last anxious glance at them, for to see them was to be reminded of what it is to be pursued, to be tracked from above while the hunters follow remorselessly. That is what ravens do; they lead the wolves to their prey, and take a portion of the spoils as payment for their labors. You want them to move. You want them to leave. Even the common raven was somehow disturbing, but these were not common ravens. No, these were most uncommon birds. Darkness was approaching, and still they waited. They might almost have been slumbering were it not for the way the fading light caught the blackness of their eyes, and how they captured the early moon when the clouds broke, imprisoning its image within themselves. </p><p>A short-tailed weasel emerged from the rotted stump that was her home and tested the air. Its brown fur was already altering, the darkness growing out of it, the mammal becoming a ghost of itself. She had been aware of the birds for some time, but she was hungry and anxious to feed. Her litter had dispersed, and she would not breed again until the new year. Her nest was lined with mouse fur for insulation, but the little larder in which she had stored her surplus of slain rodents was now empty. The weasel had to eat forty percent of her own body weight each day in order to survive. That was about four mice a day, but the animals had been scarce on her regular routes. </p><p>The ravens seemed to ignore her appearance, but the weasel was too shrewd to risk her life on the absence of movement. She turned herself so that she was facing into her nest, and used her black-tipped tail as bait to see if the birds were tempted to strike. If they did, they would miss her body in aiming for her tail and she would retreat to the safety of the stump, but the ravens did not react. The weasel&#x2019;s nose twitched. Suddenly there was sound, and light. Headlights bathed the ravens, and now their heads moved, following the beams. The weasel, torn between fright and hunger, allowed her belly to choose. She disappeared into the woods while the ravens were distracted, and was soon lost from sight. </p><p>The car wound its way along the road, traveling faster than was wise and taking the bends more widely than it should, for it was hard to see vehicles approaching from the opposite direction, and a traveler unfamiliar with this route might easily have found himself in a head-on collision, or tearing a path through the bushes that lined the road. He might, were this the kind of road that travelers took, but few visitors came here. The town absorbed their impact, the apparent dullness of it dissuading further investigation, then spat them back the way they came, over the bridge and toward Route 1, there to continue north to the border, or south to the highway and on to Augusta and Portland, the big cities, the places that the peninsula&#x2019;s residents strove so hard to avoid. So no tourists, but strangers sometimes paused here on their life&#x2019;s journey, and after a time, if they proved suitable, the peninsula would find a place for them, and they would become part of a community with its back to the land and its face set hard against the sea. </p><p>There were many such communities in this state; they attracted those who wished to escape, those who sought the protection of the frontier, for this was still an edge state with boundaries of wood and sea. Some chose the anonymity of the forests, where the wind in the trees made a sound like the breaking of waves upon the shore, an echo of the ocean&#x2019;s song to the east. But here, in this place, there were forest <i>and</i> sea; there were rocks ringing the inlet, and a narrow causeway that paralleled the bridge linking the mainland and those who had chosen to set themselves apart from it; there was a town with a single main street, and enough money to fund a small police department. The peninsula was large, with a scattered population beyond the cluster of buildings around Main Street. Also, for administrative and geographic reasons long forgotten, the township of Pastor&#x2019;s Bay stretched across the causeway and west to the mainland. For years the county sheriff policed Pastor&#x2019;s Bay until the town looked at its budget and decided that not only could it afford its own force, it might actually save money in the process, and so the Pastor&#x2019;s Bay Police Department was born. </p><p>But when locals spoke of Pastor&#x2019;s Bay it was the peninsula to which they were referring, and the police were <i>their</i> police. Outsiders often referred to it as &#x201c;the island,&#x201d; even though it was not an island because of the natural connector to the mainland, although it was the bridge that received the most traffic. It was wide enough to take a decent two-lane road, and high enough to avoid any risk of the community being entirely cut off in foul weather, although there were times when the waves rose and washed over the road, and a stone cross on the mainland side attested to the former presence on this earth of one Maylock Wheeler, who was washed away in 1997 while walking his dog, Kaya. The dog survived, and was adopted by a couple on the mainland, for Maylock Wheeler had been a bachelor of the most pronounced sort. But the dog kept trying to return to the island, as those who are born of such places often will, and eventually the couple gave up trying to hold on to it, and it was taken in by Grover Corneau, who was the chief of police at the time. It remained with Grover until his retirement, and a week separated the deaths of the dog and its owner. A photograph of them together remained on the wall of the Pastor&#x2019;s Bay Police Department. It made Kurt Allan, Grover&#x2019;s replacement, wonder if he also should acquire a dog, but Allan lived alone, and was not used to animals. </p><p>It was Allan&#x2019;s car that now passed beneath the old oak and pulled up before the house across the road. He looked to the west and shielded his eyes against the last of the setting sun, bisected by the horizon. There were more cars coming. He had told the others to follow. The woman would need them. Detectives from the Maine State Police were also on their way following the confirmation of the AMBER Alert, and the National Crime Information Center had automatically been notified of a missing child. A decision would be made within the coming hours on whether to seek further assistance from the FBI. </p><p>The house was a ranch-style dwelling, neatly kept and freshly painted. The fallen leaves had been raked and added to a compost pile at the sheltered side of the building. For a woman without a man to help her, a woman not of this place, she had managed well, he thought. </p><p>And the ravens watched as Allan knocked on the door, and the door opened, and words were spoken, and he stepped inside, and there was no sound or movement from within for a time. Two more cars arrived. From the first vehicle stepped an elderly man with a worn leather physician&#x2019;s bag. The other was driven by a woman of late middle age wearing a blue overcoat that caught in the car door as she rushed to the house. It tore, but she did not stop to examine the damage after wrench...</p></p><h2>The Unreal and the Real: Where on Earth: Selected Stories: 1</h2><p>[ The Unreal and the Real: Selected Stories Volume One: Where on Earth Le Guin, Ursula K.

She lives in Portland, OR.<br><br>IMAGINARY COUNTRIES<br><br> We can&#x2019;t drive to the river on Sunday,&#x201d; the baron said, because we&#x2019;re leaving on Friday.&#x201d; The two little ones gazed at him across the breakfast table. Zida said, Marmalade, please,&#x201d; but Paul, a year older, found in a remote, disused part of his memory a darker dining-room from the windows of which one saw rain falling. Back to the city?&#x201d; he asked. His father nodded. And at the nod the sunlit hill outside these windows changed entirely, facing north now instead of south. That day red and yellow ran through the woods like fire, grapes swelled fat on the heavy vines, and the clear, fierce, fenced fields of August stretched themselves out, patient and unboundaried, into the haze of September. Next day Paul knew the moment he woke that it was autumn, and Wednesday. This is Wednesday,&#x201d; he told Zida, tomorrow&#x2019;s Thursday, and then Friday when we leave.&#x201d;<br> I&#x2019;m not going to,&#x201d; she replied with indifference, and went off to the Little Woods to work on her unicorn trap. It was made of an eggcrate and many little bits of cloth, with various kinds of bait. She had been making it ever since they found the tracks, and Paul doubted if she would catch even a squirrel in it. He, aware of time and season, ran full speed to the High Cliff to finish the tunnel there before they had to go back to the city.<br>Inside the house the baroness&#x2019;s voice dipped like a swallow down the attic stairs. O Rosa! Where is the blue trunk then?&#x201d; And Rosa not answering, she followed her voice, pursuing it and Rosa and the lost trunk down stairs and ever farther hallways to a joyful reunion at the cellar door. Then from his study the baron heard Tomas and the trunk come grunting upward step by step, while Rosa and the baroness began to empty the children&#x2019;s closets, carrying off little loads of shirts and dresses like delicate, methodical thieves. What are you doing?&#x201d; Zida asked sternly, having come back for a coathanger in which the unicorn might entangle his hoof. Packing,&#x201d; said the maid. Not my things,&#x201d; Zida ordered, and departed. Rosa continued rifling her closet. In his study the baron read on undisturbed except by a sense of regret which rose perhaps from the sound of his wife&#x2019;s sweet, distant voice, perhaps from the quality of the sunlight falling across his desk from the uncurtained window.<br>In another room his older son Stanislas put a microscope, a tennis racket, and a box full of rocks with their labels coming unstuck into his suitcase, then gave it up. A notebook in his pocket, he went down the cool red halls and stairs, out the door into the vast and sudden sunlight of the yard. Josef, reading under the Four Elms, said, Where are you off to? It&#x2019;s hot.&#x201d; There was no time for stopping and talking. Back soon,&#x201d; Stanislas replied politely and went on, up the road in dust and sunlight, past the High Cliff where his half-brother Paul was digging. He stopped to survey the engineering. Roads metalled with white clay zigzagged over the cliff-face. The Citroen and the Rolls were parked near a bridge spanning an erosion-gully. A tunnel had been pierced and was in process of enlargement. Good tunnel,&#x201d; Stanislas said. Radiant and filthy, the engineer replied, It&#x2019;ll be ready to drive through this evening, you want to come to the ceremony?&#x201d; Stanislas nodded, and went on. His road led up a long, high hillslope, but he soon turned from it and, leaping the ditch, entered his kingdom and the kingdom of the trees. Within a few steps all dust and bright light were gone. Leaves overhead and underfoot; an air like green water through which birds swam and the dark trunks rose lifting their burdens, their crowns, towards the other element, the sky. Stanislas went first to the Oak and stretched his arms out, straining to reach a quarter of the way around the trunk. His chest and cheek were pressed against the harsh, scored bark; the smell of it and its shelf-fungi and moss was in his nostrils and the darkness of it in his eyes. It was a bigger thing than he could ever hold. It was very old, and alive, and did not know that he was there. Smiling, he went on quietly, a notebook full of maps in his pocket, among the trees towards yet-uncharted regions of his land.<br>Josef Brone, who had spent the summer assisting his professor with documentation of the history of the Ten Provinces in the Early Middle Ages, sat uneasily reading in the shade of elms. Country wind blew across the pages, across his lips. He looked up from the Latin chronicle of a battle lost nine hundred years ago to the roofs of the house called Asgard. Square as a box, with a sediment of porches, sheds, and stables, and square to the compass, the house stood in its flat yard; after a while in all directions the fields rose up slowly, turning into hills, and behind them were higher hills, and behind them sky. It was like a white box in a blue and yellow bowl, and Josef, fresh from college and intent upon the Jesuit seminary he would enter in the fall, ready to read documents and make abstracts and copy references, had been embarrassed to find that the baron&#x2019;s family called the place after the home of the northern gods. But this no longer troubled him. So much had happened here that he had not expected, and so little seemed to have been finished. The history was years from completion. In three months he had never found out where Stanislas went, alone, up the road. They were leaving on Friday. Now or never. He got up and followed the boy. The road passed a ten-foot bank, halfway up which clung the little boy Paul, digging in the dirt with his fingers, making a noise in his throat rrrm, rrrrm. A couple of toy cars lay at the foot of the bank. Josef followed the road on up the hill and presently began expecting to reach the top, from which he would see where Stanislas had gone. A farm came into sight and went out of sight, the road climbed, a lark went up singing as if very near the sun; but there was no top. The only way to go downhill on this road was to turn around. He did so. As he neared the woods above Asgard a boy leapt out onto the road, quick as a hawk&#x2019;s shadow. Josef called his name, and they met in the white glare of dust. Where have you been?&#x201d; asked Josef, sweating. In the Great Woods,&#x201d; Stanislas answered, that grove there.&#x201d; Behind him the trees gathered thick and dark. Is it cool in there?&#x201d; Josef asked wistfully. What do you do in there?&#x201d; Oh, I map trails. Just for the fun of it. It&#x2019;s bigger than it looks.&#x201d; Stanislas hesitated, then added, You haven&#x2019;t been in it? You might like to see the Oak.&#x201d; Josef followed him over the ditch and through the close green air to the Oak. It was the biggest tree he had ever seen; he had not seen very many. I suppose it&#x2019;s very old,&#x201d; he said, looking up puzzled at the reach of branches, galaxy after galaxy of green leaves without end. Oh, a century or two or three or six,&#x201d; said the boy, see if you can reach around it!&#x201d; Josef spread out his arms and strained, trying vainly to keep his cheek off the rough bark. It takes four men to reach around it,&#x201d; Stanislas said. I call it Yggdrasil. You know. Only of course Yggdrasil was an ash, not an oak. Want to see Loki&#x2019;s Grove?&#x201d; The road and the hot white sunlight were gone entirely. The young man followed his guide farther into the maze and game of names which was also a real forest: trees, still air, earth. Under tall grey alders above a dry streambed they discussed the tale of the death of Baldur, and Stanislas pointed out to Josef the dark clots, high in the boughs of lesser oaks, of mistletoe. They left the woods and went down the road towards Asgard. Josef walked along stiffly in the dark suit he had bought for his last year at the University, in his pocket a book in a dead language. Sweat ran down his face, he felt very happy. Though he had no maps and was rather late arriving, at least he had walked once through the forest. They passed Paul still burrowing, ignoring the clang of the iron triangle down at the house, which signalled meals, fires, lost children, and other noteworthy events. Come on, lunch!&#x201d; Stanislas ordered. Paul slid down the bank and they proceeded, seven, fourteen and twenty-one, sedately to the house.<br>That afternoon Josef helped the professor pack books, two trunks full of books, a small library of medieval history. Josef liked to read books, not pack them. The professor had asked him, not Tomas, Lend me a hand with the books, will you?&#x201d; It was not the kind of work he had expected to do here. He sorted and lifted and stowed away load after load of resentment in insatiable iron trunks, while the professor worked with energy and interest, swaddling incunabula like babies, handling each volume with affection and despatch. Kneeling with keys he said, Thanks, Josef! That&#x2019;s that,&#x201d; and lowering the brass catchbars locked away their summer&#x2019;s work, done with, that&#x2019;s that. Josef had done so much here that he had not expected to do, and now nothing was left to do. Disconsolate, he wandered back to the shade of the elms; but the professor&#x2019;s wife, with whom he had not expected to fall in love, was sitting there. I stole your chair,&#x201d; she said amiably, sit on the grass.&#x201d; It was more dirt than grass, but they called it grass, and he obeyed. Rosa and I are worn out,&#x201d; she said, and I can&#x2019;t bear to think of tomorrow. It&#x2019;s the worst, the next-to-last day linens and silver and turning dishes upside down and putting out mousetraps and there&#x2019;s always a doll lost and found after everybody&#x2019;s searched for hours under a pile of laundry and then sweeping the house and locking it all up. And I hate every bit of it, I hate to close this house.&#x201d; Her voice was light and plaintive as a bird&#x2019;s calling in the woods, careless whether anybody heard its plaintiveness, careless of its plaintiveness. I hope you&#x2019;ve liked it here,&#x201d; she said.<br> Very much, baroness.&#x201d;<br> I hope so. I know Severin has worked you very hard. And we&#x2019;re so disorganised. We and the children and the visitors, we always seem to scatter so, and only meet in passing. . . . I hope it hasn&#x2019;t been distracting.&#x201d; It was true; all summer in tides and cycles the house had been full or half full of visitors, friends of the children, friends of the baroness, friends, colleagues and neighbors of the baron, duck-hunters who slept in the disused stable since the spare bedrooms were full of Polish medieval historians, ladies with broods of children the smallest of whom fell inevitably into the pond about this time of the afternoon. No wonder it was so still, so autumnal now: the rooms vacant, the pond smooth, the hills empty of dispersing laughter.<br> I have enjoyed knowing the children,&#x201d; Josef said, particularly Stanislas.&#x201d; Then he went red as a beet, for Stanislas alone was not her child. She smiled and said with timidity, Stanislas is very nice. And fourteen fourteen is such a fearful age, when you find out so fast what you&#x2019;re capable of being, but also what a toll the world expects. . . . He handles it very gracefully. Paul and Zida now, when they get that age they&#x2019;ll lump through it and be tiresome. But Stanislas learned loss so young.</p><h2>The Dartmouth Murders (St. Martin&#39;s True Crime Library)</h2><p><p>On January 27, 2002, popular Dartmouth College professors Half and Susanne Zantop were found slain in their home in the wooded outskirts of Hanover, New Hampshire.

S. Van Dine was originally published in 1938 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introduction. &#39;The Gracie Allen Murder Case&#39; is one of Van Dine&#39;s novels of crime and mystery. S. S. Van Dine was born Willard Huntington Wright in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1888. He attended St. Vincent College, Pomona College and Harvard University, but failed to graduate, leaving to cultivate contacts he had made in the literary world. At the age of twenty-one, Wright began his professional writing career as literary editor of the Los Angeles Times. In 1926, Wright published his first S. S. Van Dine novel, The Benson Murder Case. Wright went on to write eleven more mysteries. The first few books about his upper-class amateur sleuth, Philo Vance, were so popular that Wright became wealthy for the first time in his life. His later books declined in popularity as the reading public&#39;s tastes in mystery fiction changed, but during the late twenties and early thirties his work was very successful.</p><p></p><h2>Harcourt Health And Fitness</h2><p>health and fitness 4th</p><p></p><h2>Poems of Phillis Wheatley</h2><p>The poetry of America&#39;s first published black poet was published before the Revolutionary War and recognized throughout the English-speaking world.

Straighten up and behave like the man you should be. You&#x2019;re my <i>son</i>, by all the gods, a Roman legate, and I&#x2019;ll ask you to remember that&#x2014;respect <i>my </i>dignity, at least, even if you show no consideration for your own.&#x201d;<br> Marcus Varrus drew his shoulders back, rigid with affront at his father&#x2019;s scorn, and watching him, Quintus knew instinctively that he was fighting not to answer too quickly. Quintus knew how much his father despised his tendency to stammer slightly when he grew upset, believing others would perceive it as a sign of weakness, and now the boy held his breath as he watched from his hiding place, seeing his grandfather&#x2019;s eyes narrow angrily in preparation for another outburst. Surprisingly, though, the old man waited, pointedly allowing his son the time to find the words he needed. <br> There were no servants in the dining room&#x2014;his grandfather had banished them as soon as this latest argument began to show signs of boiling over&#x2014;and none of the other three people sitting at the table even stirred. It seemed to Quintus that each of them was holding his or her breath too, eyes switching from one to the other of the two standing men. <br> Across from where his father and grandfather stood confronting each other as usual, his mother, Maris Antonina, appeared to be on the verge of tears, her nether lip quivering as she stared in wide-eyed supplication at her husband, willing him to keep quiet in the face of his father&#x2019;s growing wrath. Quintus&#x2019;s grandmother Alexia Seneca sat with her back to his hiding place, but he knew she would be wearing her usual ill-tempered glare of disapproval and he paid her no more attention, for among the multitude of the extensive Varrus family, she was the one he liked least. Quintus was far more interested in what his uncle Marius might be thinking of the current clash between the family&#x2019;s two dominant bulls. <br> Quintus was looking almost directly at him where he sat slouched with one elbow propped on the arm of his chair, his cheekbone resting on his knuckles as he watched the familiar, developing confrontation between his father and his brother. Marius had long since learned to watch, listen, and hold his opinions close during such arguments. Quintus knew that he was right to do so, for any attempt to intervene would instantly cause the other two to unite against him. Marius was Quintus&#x2019;s favourite among all his relatives, but to the rest of the family he was a disappointment and a black sheep. <br> Now his uncle stirred and turned slowly to look directly at Quintus&#x2019;s hiding place, one eyebrow rising high in an expression that was only slightly derisive while the lid of his other eye drooped slowly in a long, droll wink. They had shared such moments before, these two, and were veterans at surviving the constant squabbling that consumed the house�hold by refusing to become involved. In fact it was his uncle who had shown him the hiding place behind a screen in the little-used side�board, having discovered it himself as a boy. <br> The two men had been arguing for some time, each as stubborn and unyielding as the other, their voices growing louder and more bel�ligerent, with neither man showing any sign of backing down, and now the moment had come when tempers would either boil over into fury or abate into sullen, simmering resentment. When Quintus&#x2019;s father finally spoke, however, his words were far less incendiary than anyone there expected. <br> &#x201c;I was not <i>whining</i>, Father.&#x201d; Marcus spoke quietly, his voice almost calm, though his words emerged no less forcefully. &#x201c;I merely said the way the negotiations between Constantine and the Christian leaders are developing would appear, according to the Christian pontifex, to be the will of god&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;I heard what you said!&#x201d; his father bellowed. &#x201c;God&#x2019;s <i>will </i>was what you said, by all the gods at once. Or is it the <i>one </i>god&#x2019;s will, is that what you mean? The Christian god&#x2019;s? And if that <i>is </i>your meaning, tell me this: since when have you or I or any of us paid lip service to the god of the Christians or to his will? Since when have we abandoned our Roman gods? Did I not fight for years for my belief in them, spilling Christian blood under Diocletian&#x2019;s command in protection of our ancient deities? And since when has <i>any </i>man, priest or emperor, presumed to know the will of the gods? Is this Christian pontifex of yours more powerful than Rome&#x2019;s own Pontifex Maximus&#x2014;or even more learned than Constantine and his advisors&#x2014;that he dares to make such claims?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;The Christian leader calls himself a bishop, not a pontifex,&#x201d; Marcus answered. &#x201c;That error was mine. But yes, he believes he is all those things. He believes it because&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Hah! I <i>know </i>why he believes it. He believes it because he has no other choice, because his life and his livelihood depend upon it. He believes it because he <i>has </i>to. He believes it loudly and incessantly, day in and day out, because were he to stop proclaiming his belief from the rooftops, even for a day, he would be a dead man in very little time. He would starve, as men with nothing of value have always starved, or someone would kill him for lying to them for so long. He continues to live solely because most men are cowards and walk in fear of this god of his who might&#x2014;just <i>might</i>&#x2014;be able to strike them down from afar by some kind of sorcery or necromancy, though in truth he has no more physical substance than has Mars or Vulcan. What about you, Marcus Varrus? Do you believe this god of his has such power? What do you really know of this god, this Jesus that they worship? He&#x2019;s Jewish, is he not? A Hebrew from Judea?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;He was. At least the man who reared him as his son was.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Aha! The father of the god. Well, at least he&#x2019;s not so omnipotent that he can exist without a father. So, then, a Jewish, therefore an anti- Roman, god. Do you believe this Jewish Christian god has power over all the earth and skies?&#x201d; He held up a warning hand. &#x201c;You yourself, I mean. Not his followers&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t care what <i>they </i>think. Do <i>you </i>believe he has such power?&#x201d; <br> Marcus looked steadily back at his father. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Father,&#x201d; he said finally. &#x201c;If he is a god, as they say he is, then perhaps he has. But I&#x2019;m not a Christian, as you are well aware. I merely work with them, as Constantine&#x2019;s envoy.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;But your wife is one of them.&#x201d; Grandfather Titanius turned his head to look at his daughter-in-law, Maris, for whom he had always shown great affection. &#x201c;What think you, Daughter? Do you believe your Jesus god is all-powerful?&#x201d; <br> Quintus&#x2019;s mother tilted her head high. &#x201c;I do, Father,&#x201d; she said quietly. <br> The old man grunted. &#x201c;I know you do, girl, and in a strange way I envy you your conviction, for I know it is real and deeply felt. But tell me this: do you believe this meek and humble Jesus god, whom your people call the Christus, would wantonly destroy a large group of men who offered him no offence? Could such a thing occur?&#x201d; <br> Maris kept her chin held high, not haughty or defiant, but solemn and secure in her beliefs. Quintus saw that she was frowning slightly, however, as though troubled by her father-in-law&#x2019;s question, and he sensed that his mother was unwilling to respond too quickly to a query that might have hidden barbs. He himself had detected a strangeness in the deliberate way the question had been phrased. His father, too, was reacting to some sudden tension in the air, frowning in concern at his wife, then shifting his eyes suspiciously towards his father. <br> &#x201c;Why would you ask Maris that, Father? She has no&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Be quiet and listen. This is important. Maris? Could that happen?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Could it&#x2014;? Let me understand you clearly, Father Titanius. Wantonly, you said. Are you then asking me if my God would wantonly destroy anyone or anything without provocation?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;I am.&#x201d; <br> She sat up straighter, turning the flap of her decorative stole back over her shoulder with one hand. &#x201c;No, Father Titanius, my God would never do such a thing.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;And he is the one, true God, you believe? The only one?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;That is what we believe.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;There are no others?&#x201d; <br> Maris again shook her head. &#x201c;Men speak of other gods, but they are all false. God is God. A single being, although with many names. The Creator of all life.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;And he is triune, is he not? Threefold? Father, son, and spirit, all in one?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;So we believe.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;And what about the threefold deity of Egypt&#x2014;Osiris, Horus, and Isis&#x2014;that ruled before him? Does that not give you pause?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;There was no God before Him, Father Titanius. God is God. It matters not what names men give to the Deity.&#x201d; <br> Titanius Varrus gave his son a sidelong glance before swinging back to address his daughter-in-law again. &#x201c;Was your God omnipotent when Diocletian ruled the empire?&#x201d; <br> Maris smiled gently, nodding her head as though humouring a child. &#x201c;He was omnipotent before Rome began, Father, before the empire came to be. He made this world and all things in it.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Of course. I merely wanted to be sure.&#x201d; He turned again to face his son, whose eyes flicked between his wife and his father. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; the old man continued, &#x201c;if this god will do no harm unprovoked and there is no other with his supernatural powers, how can we, or anyone, explain what happened to Petronius Provo&#x2019;s two cohorts in Dacia?&#x201d; <br> For a space of heartbeats there was no response, and safe in his hiding place Quintus tensed and leaned forward, one hand cupping his ear towards the men so as not to miss a single syllable of what was to come. When his father did speak, though, he sounded mystified. <br> &#x201c;Petronius Provo,&#x201d; his father said. &#x201c;I know that name, or I used to . . . Is he not a friend of yours?&#x201d; <br> His father grunted. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a dead man now. Long since gone. But he and I were close once. We grew up together. He and Diocles and I.&#x201d; <br> Marcus was frowning in concentration. &#x201c;I remember that, too,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;At least I think I do. A long time ago, and there was something that happened in Dacia. I don&#x2019;t remember . . . What was it?&#x201d; <br> The older man scowled, glowering from beneath his bushy eye�brows as he peered into nothingness. &#x201c;No one was ever able to say what it was,&#x201d; he growled. <br> Quintus squirmed a little as he saw his father assume his affronted look again, peering about him theatrically as though to emphasize his disbelief. Even at the age of ten Quintus knew it was an affectation, but he suspected that his father was unaware of the mannerism, or that he used it so obviously. <br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; Marcus Varrus said. &#x201c;Do you mean that this event, involving damage or detriment to two prime cohorts in the field, went unreported?&#x201d; <br> Titanius Varrus straightened up slightly, his eyes narrowing further as he contemplated his firstborn son with increasingly withering contempt. &#x201c;Oh, you love the thought of that, don&#x2019;t you,&#x201d; he said, his voice barely audible. &#x201c;An error of omission in the highest ranks, in the field. A missing tactical report, depriving the Emperor&#x2019;s busy little fact-finders of an opportunity to pry into places they should never be allowed to see. That sets your little martial heart to fluttering, does it not?&#x201d; He grimaced, before squaring his shoulders and speaking again in his normal voice, the syllables emerging from his mouth crisply and in the tones of a military report. &#x201c;If your question was intended to imply that someone present failed in his duty to record the magnitude of what took place that day, then my answer is that the sole failure of any person present at the events of that day was the failure to survive.&#x201d; <br> Quintus had heard every word, but he had no idea what his grand�father had actually said. <br> &#x201c;What&#x2014;?&#x201d; Marcus swallowed. &#x201c;I must have misheard. Did you say, a failure to <i>survive</i>?&#x201d; <br> Titanius Varrus nodded. &#x201c;That is precisely what I said. Whatever happened in Dacia that afternoon, not a single person lived to tell of it.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s . . . that is clearly impossible, Father. Some must have survived, no matter how great the damage. There must have been at least two thousand men there.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;There would have been, normally,&#x201d; Titanius said, eyeing his son levelly. &#x201c;I would even say perhaps three thousand, were one to include the usual adherents&#x2014;families, retainers, camp followers, and the like. In this instance, though, all of those were marching with me in the main body, because Provo and his men were on high alert, carrying their own rations and moving too urgently and too quickly to wait for a baggage train and extra bodies. Also, we had been out there for a few months and had twice taken heavy casualties, so all told there were probably little more than a thousand men in his group. Eleven hun�dred at most. But every single one of them died.&#x201d;</p><h2>Battalion of the Damned: The 1st Marine Paratroopers at Gavutu and Bloody Ridge, 1942</h2><p>In May 1942 the Japanese landed on a number of southern islands in the British Solomons and began constructing an airfield on Guadalcanal. Their actions threatened Australia and her vital American supply lines and could not be tolerated by the Allies. The 1st Marine Division, with its attached 1st Marine Parachute Battalion, was directed to spearhead the assault on Gavutu Island and take the Guadalcanal airfield, even though it was not prepared for such an offensive action. The result was a bloodbath, and when it was over, less that one in five of the Marine paratroopers walked off Bloody Ridge. <p>Although crucial to the action, the 1st Parachute Battalion is rarely credited for its part in what Gen. Alexander A. Vandergrift, USMC, called the key battle of the Guadalcanal campaign. Here, James F. Christ draws not only on government documents but also on hundreds of hours of interviews with the men who were there to tell their remarkable story. It is a story of how in the face of overwhelming odds and seemingly irrational decisions from above, the battalion fought heroically, accepting orders without question and adapting to circumstances beyond its control despite sickness and a critical shortage of resources. In bringing public attention to the contributions made by these men during the first amphibious assault by U.S. forces in World War II, this book adds significantly to the history of the war in the Pacific.</p></p><p>JAMES F.

Eloquent and heartfelt."&#x2015; <i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>Of the many highly esteemed books Albert Schweitzer penned in his life, he valued his autobiography the most. He had become a legend and he wanted to remind readers that he was just a man, and a man who had learned from many others. He had been fortunate to be in the right places at the right times, to meet people of thought and sympathy. He wanted to report his debts to them. He wanted to clarify his reasons and methods for his undertakings and to respond to some of his critics. And, he wished to honor something greater than he was&#x2015;reverence for life. Reverence for Life became his life's motto, and it brought him pain as well as joy as he sought to respect how precious and unique each life is. Schweitzer believed there was a way to live in the world, accept it, take joy from it&#x2015;and who could know this better than a man who had placed himself so much in it, given so much for it, and had been ready to receive experience as a gift to be thankful for. </p><p>In addition to a preface by Rhena Schweitzer Miller and Antje Bultmann Lemke, this translation incorporates revisions and additions Schweitzer made for the French translation of 1960 and those he made for thirty years in his own copy of the original German edition. </p><p>"This fascinating volume is the autobiography of the world-famous missionary doctor, organist, philosopher, theologian, and Nobel Peace Prize-winner, newly translated, researched, and corrected on the basis of recently discovered material."&#x2015; <i>Booklist</i></p><p>"An authentic twentieth-century classic. Few books in our time have had a greater impact on the life and values of untold numbers of people."&#x2015;Norman Cousins</p></p><p><i>Out of My Life and Thought</i> is the autobiography of Albert Schweitzer, the theologian, musician, scientist, and medical missionary who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952 (and donated his prize to build a leper colony). Schweitzer's autobiography is a masterful and motley blend of confession, narrative, adventure, and philosophy. The chapters about how he came to write <i>The Quest for the Historical Jesus</i> and <i>The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle</i> are indispensable summaries of and apologies for those books; the chapter called "I Resolve to Become a Jungle Doctor" is a model of Rilke-style life-changing decision; and the chapters on Bach and on organs are full of fascinating historical and mechanical detail. For contemporary readers, <i>Out of My Life and Thought</i> may be most compelling for its epilogue, which describes the ethical mysticism that Schweitzer called "Reverence for Life," which he achieved in his later years. The epilogue is full of stirringly Germanic passages such as the following: "Once man begins to think about the mystery of his life and the links connecting him with the life that fills the world, he cannot but accept, for his own life and all other life that surrounds him, the principle of Reverence for Life. He will act according to this principle of the ethical affirmation of life in everything he does. His life will become in every respect more difficult than if he lived for himself, but at the same time it will be richer, more beautiful, and happier. It will become, instead of mere living, a genuine experience of life." Because Schweitzer believed Christianity implied such world-encompassing reverence, he had the confidence and faith to "demand from Christianity that it reform itself in the spirit of sincerity and with thoughtfulness, so it may become conscious of its true nature." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>The best known of Albert Schweitzer's many books</p></p><h2>IZ: Voice of the People (Israel Kamakawiwo&#39;ole)</h2><p>Here, nine years after his death at the age of 38, is the full story of how a local Hawaiian boy rose to unrivaled celebrity on the strength of his one-in-a-million voice and a four-string ukulele.

Featuring many never-before-published photos and based on scores of personal interviews, articles, and anecdotes from family, friends, recording artists, and fans, this definitive chronicle examines the life and times of Israel Kamakawiwo&#x2018;ole, one of Hawai&#x2018;i&#x2019;s greatest musicians.</p><p>Award-winning journalist and travel writer Rick Carroll is the author of many books about Hawai&#x2018;i, including six titles in the best-selling Hawai&#x2018;i's Best Spooky Tales series. With his wife, Marcie Carroll, he edited Hawai&#x2018;i: True Stories of the Island Spirit, which critics called &#x201c;the best example of contemporary Hawai&#x2018;i nonfiction.&#x201d; Their other books in national release include The Unofficial Guide to Hawaii and The Unofficial Guide to Maui.</p><h2>The Mafia Manager</h2><p>The world's oldest and best-organized conglomerate now reveals management techniques everyone can use. Unlike other guides to business, <i>The Mafia Manager </i>shuns theoretical verbiage to present the philosophy of leadership that founded and captained "The Silent Empire" through centuries of expansion and success. Some sample pearls of wisdom:<br><br>-"Be sure you understand what your boss has ordered before you act on his command. What if you whack the wrong guy, or bomb the wrong joint...Learn the art of asking questions." <br>-"Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer." <br>-"Don't become involved in any office political battle without first asking yourself, 'What's in it for me?' and then 'What's in it for them?'"<br>-"If you must lie, be brief."<br></p><p>V., a capo of distinguished fame, keeps several residences around the world. His present location is a guarded secret.<br>In a manner that hints of power and money, author "V" lays down guidelines for business garnered from his years of service in the Mafia. Is he kidding? Perhaps. But the level of common sense displayed could fool the reader. Each of the three sections is filled with riffs on the main theme; part two, "Managing Others," covers such topics as hiring, firing, senior advisers, leadership, productivity, and rules, all sprinkled with appropriate company aphorisms and syllogisms. Machiavellian? You bet. Chauvinistic? For sure. But the book is also a great antidote to the disease of serious, boring, humorless corporate-speak tomes. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>The Parrot Problem Solver</h2><p>When not properly trained and socialized, parrots are prone to developing a number of behavioral problems, including aggression and self-mutilation.

Leah McDevitt shifted slightly in the narrow seat, clutching the worn brown leather portfolio to her chest and smiling even in her sleep. Dreaming, no doubt, of the expression on her cousin Catherine's face when she saw the article Leah would deliver for the May issue of <i>Trends,</i> the bimonthly magazine they had inherited from their uncle eight years earlier.<br><br>Pragmatic Catherine, the heir to the majority of shares as well as Uncle Harry's business sense and his position as editor-in-chief, had long since proven herself a worthy successor. Leah, having been born with a healthy dose of wanderlust and a freewheeling, creative spirit, was delighted to have been given carte blanche in the features department, where she had seemingly endless opportunities to travel, permitting her to acquire a firsthand knowledge of exotic cultures and explore new vistas, much of which would eventually grace the pages of Trends in one form or another.<br><br>Leah's current project, photos plus text, had taken her on a jaunt to trace the use of tattoos -- a current hot fashion trend -- through antiquity. From Egypt to Greece to Turkey, she'd been fascinated by her finds and hoped that her readers would be also. In a museum in Greece, there had been fourth- and fifth-century Greek vase paintings that depicted women with strategically placed tattoos intended to accentuate their muscular physiques. The designs -- vines, geometrics, spirals, and animals -- were almost contemporary in nature, and she could barely wait to see the color photos she'd taken. She'd learned that throughout the ages, tattoos had served to mark prisoners of war and slaves in some cultures just as frequently as they were used as symbols of beauty and wealth in others. The tiny tattoo of an owl on a modern youth might be chosen to symbolize wisdom. The ancient Athenians, however, used it to mark the foreheads of their prisoners of war.<br><br>Leah yawned and opened her eyes momentarily, snippets of the article already floating around in her head, eager now to get home and work her notes into their final form before deciding on her next venture. The silver jewelry she'd seen in the marketplace in Turkey had been lovely enough to tempt her to return, and the fabrics she had purchased in Bulgaria -- along with the attar of roses the country was known for -- had caught and held her imagination. Perhaps an article about Eastern European crafts? Then again, there had been those ancient adobes in the American southwest...<br><br>Leah shifted again to ease the weight on her left hip and leaned her head against the window. They'd be in Amsterdam soon, then on to New York. She had yet to decide whether she'd go straight to the country house in Connecticut -- little more than a cabin, really -- or to the brownstone in Manhattan, another bequest from Uncle Harry, she shared with Catherine. Knowing she had at least a dozen more hours before she'd have to make the decision, she covered her yawning mouth with her hand and permitted herself to drift back to sleep.<br><br>It was almost two in the morning when Leah collected her luggage and began to make her way through JFK Airport. Well rested after having spent so much of her time sleeping on the plane, she was looking forward to writing her article. Once outside, she spotted the car she'd arranged to pick her up and opted to go straight downtown to the office, rather than to the townhouse where she would more than likely awaken Catherine upon arrival. <br><br>The lobby of the narrow, weathered brick six-story Dean Building was well lit, the guard at the horseshoe-shaped front desk clearly visible from the street. The car pulled up in front, bringing the guard to the front door to investigate, one hand on his cell phone. Leah waved as she climbed out of the backseat, and, recognizing her, the guard unlocked the front door.<br><br>"I wasn't expecting anyone. It's late for anyone to be out." He said this almost accusingly, as if irritated to be taken from the warmth of the lobby on such a frigid night.<br><br>"I should have thought to call you, Frank. I'm sorry." Leah flashed him her best smile. "I'm just back from my trip and thought I'd stop in and do a little work, since I slept through most of my flight." <br><br>"I have coffee on in the kitchen," he offered as apology for having chastised her, however mildly he'd done so. After all, he did, in a manner of speaking, work, if not for her, then certainly for her family.<br><br>And he'd known all of them, from the Harry Dean who founded the magazine that over the years had become <i>Trends</i> -- it had been <i>Milestones</i> back then -- to Harry's children, Sally, Harry, Jr., and Anna, all gone now, Harry, Jr., having outlived Sally by a year, Anna by many more. As Harry, Jr., had no children of his own, the magazine had passed into the hands of his nieces, his only living relatives, upon his death.<br><br>This new generation was surely different, Frank shook his head imperceptibly. That a young lady would show up at a Manhattan office building in the middle of the night to work! Certainly, Leah's mother, Sally, would never have done such a thing, but then, <i>kids today,</i> he rolled his eyes.<br><br>"Coffee sounds great. I'll grab a cup on the way up. Thanks, Frank." She rolled her wheeled suitcase close to the desk. "I'll just leave this here, if you don't mind. No sense in hauling it upstairs."<br><br>"I'll take care of it for you," Frank said, tucking the suitcase closer to the area behind the desk. "It'll be right here when you want it."<br><br>Leah ducked into the small room, no larger than a closet, and helped herself to a Styrofoam cup that she filled with dark fragrant liquid. Day or night, one could always find a good cup of coffee in the lobby of the Dean Building, if one knew where to look. She sipped at it appreciatively, tucked the leather portfolio under one arm, and hoisted her travel bag over her shoulder before heading to the elevators. She touched the arrow pointing upward with her one free finger and the doors slid open immediately, as if awaiting her pleasure. Leaning forward to tap the button for the fifth floor, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirrored wall.<br><br>In baggy khaki pants and a navy pea jacket, her dark hair tucked behind her ears and held back with a loose ribbon, her face bare of makeup, Leah looked younger than her thirty years. The large canvas travel bag over her left shoulder weighed her down, and she listed slightly to one side to compensate for its weight. She looked more like a graduate student returning from a vacation than the features editor of a popular magazine returning from a business trip.<br><br>Leah stepped off the elevator onto a well-carpeted floor and followed the silent hallway to her office. Unlocking the door and turning on the light, she sighed when she saw the mountain of mail that awaited her attention.<br><br><i>Well, it will all have to wait just a little longer,</i> Leah thought as she dropped her bag on the floor and turned on her computer. Pushing the stack of envelopes aside, she pulled her notes out of the brown leather folder and spread them out upon her desk. Slipping into her chair, she toed off her shoes as she sipped pensively at her coffee, her opening line already formed and at her fingertips. She set the cup down and began to type, her thoughts clicking along as smoothly and efficiently as a commuter train. Later she would download the photos she had taken and begin the process of deciding which to use.<br><br>Three hours later, as the sun was just beginning to rise, Leah rolled her chair back from her desk and read the copy for the tenth time, changing a word here, a phrase there, also for the tenth time. Rubbing the back of her neck she decided that what she had was a good first draft. Achy and stiff from sitting so long in the same position, she rose and, after a series of stretching exercises, went into the small bathroom to the left of her office where she splashed cool water on her face. Still patting her skin dry with a pale blue towel, she rummaged in the small refrigerator near her desk in search of a cold bottle of spring water. Finding one near the back behind a container of long-expired peach yogurt, she sat back down at her desk, refreshed and, she figured, good for at least another hour or so.<br><br>Leah was determined to finish the article and leave it on Catherine's desk so that it would be there when her cousin arrived for work. Which should be soon, she realized after glancing at her watch. Catherine was an early riser and could be found at her desk most mornings by seven o'clock.<br><br><i>Maybe one more read-through,</i> maybe just a little more polish, Leah thought, hitting the print icon on her computer.<br><br>Leah preferred to do her editing on paper rather than on the computer screen. As she stood up and leaned forward to reach the pages that slid quietly from her printer, she knocked over the pile of mail and memos she had previously shoved aside. Cursing softly, she knelt down to pick them up.<br><br>Carolyn, her ever-efficient assistant, had put little sticky notes on just about every item in the stack.<br><br>"Proofs for the beach-bum article" was printed neatly on one. "Call Mr. Allen in production on this piece...he says it's too long," read another. "This woman called three times but wouldn't tell me what she wanted" was noted on one of the pink telephone messages. "This is marked <i>P &amp; C,</i> so I didn't open it" sat upon a plain white envelope on which her name and address were neatly printed in blue ink.<br><br>Dropping everything else to the side of her desk, she slipped one finger under the partially opened flap on the back of the envelope marked personal and confidential.<br><br>"Damn," she muttered as the paper sliced into her finger, causing a thin line of red to emerge. "I hate paper cuts."<br><br>Leah stuck the bleeding finger into her mouth and pulled the cheap white paper from the envelope, snapping it slightly to open it flat.<br><br>It took several readings before she understood the message. Even then, she did not -- could not -- believe what she was seeing. Her knees weak, she dropped into her chair and, with shaking hands, read it over yet again.<br><br>And then she began to cry.<br><br>"<i>Dear Ms. McDevitt,</i>" Catherine read aloud from the letter a white-faced Leah had met her with before she'd even managed to welcome her cousin home or open her office door. "<i>I saw you on that television show, the one about missing persons. I know where your sister is. Does this mean I get the reward? Signed, Raymond Lambert.</i>"<br><br>Catherine's eyes had widened with every word. Finally, she looked up at Leah and said, "It's another hoax, honey. You know it is. Just like the others have all been."<br><br>"Cath, the others weren't from Raymond Lambert."<br><br>"And you don't know that this one is." The letter rattled slightly as Catherine waved her hand. "It's possible that someone else wrote it. Anyone could use his name."<br><br>"Sure. Anyone on death row at the Robert Orville Johnson Correction Center down there in Warehamville, Texas, could be using his name."<br><br>"That's right." <br><br>"Catherine, you do know who Raymond Lambert is, don't you?"<br><br>"Yes. Of course." <br><br>One of America's most notorious serial killers, Raymond Lambert was currently on death row awaiting a lethal injection that three other states also would love to administer. Texas had earned the right, however, by virtue of the fact that they'd caught him first and tried and sentenced him even before his long trail of homicides had been unraveled.<br><br>Catherine tossed the letter onto her desk and sat down, her bottom jaw clenched.<br><br>"There's never been any connection between Melissa's disappearance and Raymond Lambert, Leah. Through all the trials, and all the hoopla over this guy, all of his confessions, he's never mentioned her name." Catherine spoke as if she was thinking aloud. "He -- or someone else -- is simply playing with you. Didn't the host of that television show ask you if the reward was still available?"<br><br>Leah nodded.<br><br>"And you said something like, 'The reward will stand until we find out what happened to my sister.' That's pretty much what you said, wasn't it?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Sweetie, fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money. People have told much bigger lies for a whole lot less."<br><br>Leah pulled a high-back leather chair close to her cousin's desk and sat down, her elbows resting on the highly polished desktop, and studied Catherine's finely boned face. Catherine's blue eyes had darkened and narrowed with concern, her mouth had been drawn into a tight, controlled line.<br><br>Catherine Connor had not risen to the top of her field by losing her head even under the most emotional circumstances. Calculated where Leah was spontaneous, precise where Leah might be impulsive, Catherine managed the magazine in the same manner in which she managed her life. There was no room in either for anything that wasn't concrete, factual. This letter was obviously a hoax as far as Catherine was concerned and, as such, merited no more of her time.<br><br>"What if he really knows, Cat?" Leah asked softly.<br><br>"He doesn't." Catherine rolled the letter up into a ball and tossed it in the direction of the trash can.<br><br>She missed. The paper ball rolled slightly to the left and bounced off the wall.<br><br>"Leah, I'm so sorry. God knows that I would do anything in this world to find Melissa. But I don't believe for one second that this guy is doing anything but pulling your chain. If I recall correctly, he was known to enjoy torturing people. Don't be another one of his victims, Lee."<br><br>"All these years, I've wanted to believe that she was out there, somewhere." Leah looked across the desk at Catherine with eyes that were suddenly very weary. "Everyone thinks I'm crazy to believe that she could still be alive. Maybe I am -- "<br><br>"Of course you're not, sweetie," Catherine's response was quick and certain. "There are thousands of stories about people who had been missing forever showing up unexpectedly years later. As long as you and I believe she could still come home, does it matter what anyone else thinks?"<br><br>The phone buzzed rudely.<br><br>"Yes?" Catherine asked of her secretary.<br><br>"Ellen Petersen is on the line."<br><br>"Thank you." Catherine turned back to Leah, her voice softening. "I'm sorry, sweetie, I have to take this call. If I thought there was any chance that Lambert knew anything about Melissa's disappearance, I'd be on the first plane to Texas. But he doesn't. Let it go."<br><br>Leah rose without responding, pushing herself out of her chair with heavy hands and walking to the door on leaden feet. The balled-up letter lay near the door, and she bent down to pick it up.<br><br>Crushing it within her fisted hand, she returned to her office and looked out the window, her mind abuzz with a million thoughts that careened off each other like tiny bumper cars.<br><br>Finally she buzzed Carolyn.<br><br>"Carolyn, please call archives and get me everything -- I mean <i>everything</i> -- you can get your hands on about Raymond Lambert."<br><br>"Raymond Lambert?

Now, complete beginners can learn everything they need to know to knit beautiful and cozy garments, blankets, and accessories. Begin by selecting needles and yarn and then start practicing the basic knitting and purling stitches and their variations, including the loop stitch, slip stitch, and crossed stitch. When you're ready, move on to tubular stitches, and learn to increase and decrease your rows of stitches and bind off to finish your work. Instructions are given for a wide range of garment pieces and styles, including various necklines, collars, sleeves, buttonholes, and pockets. Find out how to correct mistakes and mend holes. Add interest to your projects with decorations such as pearls, sequins, and jewels; jacquard and smock stitches, embroidery, braids, fringes and pompoms. Make baby booties, mittens, gloves, socks, sweaters and more.<br></p><p>Although the title suggests that readers seeking a full knitting tutorial will be able to use this as a master guide, its true purpose lies in its presentation of a variety of knitting techniques for intermediate to advanced knitters and designers. The instructions begin with the basics-casting on, knitting and purling-but the lack of any text other than straight directions may actually confuse and discourage beginners. The volume jumps rather haphazardly from the tools needed (though beginning knitters won't require as many as are listed) to how to design a sweater, before moving on to shaping and complicated stitches (including the little-used tubular stitch), which may baffle novices. However, the clear illustrations are helpful in other areas, such as the comprehensive sections on piecing sleeves, collars, wristbands, hems, edgings, buttonholes, pockets and mending. Basic but worthwhile instructions on embroidery, special stitches and a few small projects, such as gloves, baby booties and socks, are also handy, but instructions on knitting shoulder pads and pleats seem to have come from another century, when knitters had no resources except yarn and needles. While the full-color drawings are very clear, it's too bad that there are no photographs depicting, for example, a correctly completed stitch. Somewhere between a knitting encyclopedia and a beginner's handbook, this volume falls a bit short on both accounts, but it should greatly benefit knitting devotees who want a few techniques at their fingertips when designing sweaters. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.A complete course? Pretty darn close. This oversize and highly visual book begins with the basics and then details many techniques that are often not used even by experienced knitters simply because they don't know how: edgings, blocking, more elaborate ways of increasing and decreasing, pleating, and knitting with beads. Instructions, diagrams, and illustrations are all crisp and effective. Although brand-new knitters may not be able to simply work from a book, those who are past the scarf-making stage will be able to follow right along. An attractive treat for knitters who want to learn about going to the next level without jumping into more difficult patterns. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In the wake of the contested presidential election of 1876, white supremacist mobs swept across the South, killing and driving out the last of the Reconstruction state governments. A strike involving millions of railroad workers turned violent as it spread from coast-to-coast, and for a moment seemed close to toppling the nation&#x2019;s economic structure.<br><br>In <i>1877</i>, celebrated historian Michael Bellesiles reveals that the fires of that fated year also fueled a hothouse of cultural and intellectual innovation. Bellesiles relates the story of 1877 not just through dramatic events, but also through the lives of famous and little-known Americans.</p><p>Michael Bellesiles teaches history at Central Connecticut State University. He is a nationally known historian who has been vilified, many think unfairly. This book will reestablish his reputation. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture</i>. He lives in Connecticut.If you think the United States has problems today, try 1877. That single year, according to historian Bellesiles, saw an unprecedented surge in lynchings, racism, homicides, army attacks on Indians, labor violence (including a near national general strike), quack theories to explain it all, and a political crisis whose resolution on the backs of African-Americans scarred the nation until Johnson's Great Society. Offering a thorough review of this crisis-ridden year, Bellesiles, author of the controversial Arming America, makes the case that 1877 was also a year of breakthroughs in thought and creativity (Thomas Edison made the first voice recording, and Wannamaker's, the first department store, opened). But it is the violence that preoccupies the author, and he attributes it at least in part to Americans, in the midst of a depression, struggling "to come to terms with their new industrial society...." No reader will come away from this sobering work without a greater understanding of violence so extreme that contemporaries and numerous historians have commented on it (one historians called it "a symbol of shock, of the possible crumbling of society"). It's not easy reading, but it is solid, deeply informed history. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A veritable Hall of Fame list of competitors had gathered that spring in Augusta, Georgia, for the game's most famous event, including Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Gary Player, Lee Trevino, Hale Irwin, Billy Casper, and Sam Snead. The lead-up had been dominated by Lee Elder, the first black golfer ever invited to the exclusive club's tourney. But by the weekend, the tournament turned into a showdown between the three heavyweights of the time: Jack Nicklaus, Johnny Miller, and Tom Weiskopf. Never before had golf's top three players of the moment summoned the best golf of their lives in the same major championship. Their back-and-forth battle would rivet the sporting world and dramatically culminate in one of the greatest finishes in golf history.<br><br>In <i>The Magnificent Masters</i>, Gil Capps, a twenty-two-year veteran of the golf industry with NBC Sports and Golf Channel, recaptures hole-by-hole the thrilling drama of this singular event during golf's golden era, from the media-crazed build-up and intertwined careers of the three combatants to the tournament's final dramatic putts that would change the game of golf forever.<br></p><p><b>Gil Capps</b> is an Emmy award-winning associate producer on NBC Sports golf telecasts and managing editor at Golf Channel.

The winner of multiple awards, she lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where she spends time mentoring and encouraging young writers.Sir Beccaroon cocked his head, ruffled his neck feathers, and stretched, allowing his crimson wings to spread. The branch beneath him sank and rose again, responding to his weight. Moist, hot air penetrated his finery, and he held his wings away from his brilliant blue sides.<br>&#x201c;Too hot for company,&#x201d; hemuttered, rocking back and forth from one scaly four-toed foot to the other on a limb of a sacktrass tree.The leaves shimmered as the motion rippled along the branch. &#x201c;Where is<br>that girl?&#x201d;<br>His yellow head swiveled almost completely around. He peered with one eye down the overgrown path and then scoped out every inch within his range of vision, twisting his neck slowly. A brief morning shower had penetrated the canopy above and rinsed the waxy leaves. A few remaining drops glistened where thin shafts of tropical sun touched the dark green foliage. On the broot vine, flowers the size of plates lifted their fiery red petals, begging the thumb-sized bees to come drink before the weight of nectar broke off the blooms.<br>Beccaroon flew to a perch on a gnarly branch. He sipped from a broot blossom and ran his black tongue over the edges of his beak. A sudden breeze shook loose a sprinkle of leftover raindrops. Beccaroon<br>shook his tail feathers and blinked.When the disturbance settled, he cocked his head and listened.<br>&#x201c;Ah! She&#x2019;s coming.&#x201d; He preened his soft green breast and waited, giving a show of patience he didn&#x2019;t feel. His head jerked up as he detected someone walking with the girl.<br>&#x201c;Awk!&#x201d;The sound exploded from his throat.He flew into a roost far above the forest floor, where he couldn&#x2019;t be seen from the ground, and watched the approach of the girl placed under his guardianship.<br>Tipper strolled along the path below, wearing a flowing golden gown over her tall, lean body. She&#x2019;d put her long blond hair in a fancy braid that started at the crown of her head. A golden chain hung from<br>each of her pointed ears. And she&#x2019;d decorated her pointed facial features with subdued colors&#x2014;blue for her eyelids, rose for her lips, and a shimmering yellow on her cheeks. Beccaroon sighed. His girl was<br>lovely.<br>The bushes along the path behind her rustled. Beccaroon&#x2019;s tongue clucked against his beak in disapproval. Hanner trudged after Tipper, leading a donkey hitched to a cart. The man&#x2019;s shaggy hair, tied with a string at the back of his neck, hung oily and limp. Food and drink stained the front of his leather jerkin, and his boots woremud instead of a shine. The parrot caught a whiff of the o&#x2019;rant from where he<br>perched. The young man should have carried the fragrance of citrus, but his overstrong odor reminded Beccaroon of rotten fruit.<br>A tree full ofmonkeys broke out in outraged chatter.Tipper, when alone, walked amid the animals&#x2019; habitat without causing alarm.<br>&#x201c;Smart monkeys,&#x201d; said Beccaroon. &#x201c;You recognize a ninny-nap-conder when you see one.&#x201d; He used the cover of the monkeys&#x2019; rabble-rousing to glide to another tree, where he could hide at a lower level. He had an idea where Tipper would lead Hanner.<br>&#x201c;Here it is,&#x201d; said the pretty emerlindian. She pulled vines from a clump, revealing a gray statue beneath. &#x201c;My father named this one <i>Vegetable Garden.</i>&#x201d;<br>Hanner pulled off more vines as he made his way slowly around the four-foot statue. &#x201c;<i>Vegetable Garden</i>? Mistress Tipper, are you sure you have the right one? This is a statue of a boy reading a book. He&#x2019;s not even chewing a carrot while he sits here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Father used to say reading a good book was nourishment.&#x201d;<br>Hanner scratched his head, shrugged his shoulders, and went to fetch the donkey and cart.Tipper&#x2019;s head tilted back, and her blue eyes looked up into the trees. Her gaze roamed over the exact spot Beccaroon used as a hidden roost. Not by the blink of an eyelash did she betray whether she had seen him. Hanner returned.<br>Tipper spread out a blanket in the cart after Hanner maneuvered it next to the statue, then helped him lift the stone boy into the back. Hanner grunted a lot, and Tipper scolded.<br>&#x201c;Careful... Don&#x2019;t break his arm...Too many vines still around the base.&#x201d;<br>They got the statue loaded, and Tipper tucked the blanket overand around it. She then gave Hanner a pouch of coins.<br>&#x201c;This is for your usual delivery fee. I couldn&#x2019;t put in any extra for traveling expenses. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll be reimbursed by our buyer.&#x201d;<br>He grunted and slipped the money inside his jerkin.<br>Tipper clasped her hands together. &#x201c;Be careful. And give Master Dodderbanoster my regards.&#x201d;<br>He tipped his hat and climbed aboard the cart. &#x201c;I always am. And I always do.&#x201d;<br>She stood in the path until the creak of the cart wheels could no longer be heard.<br>Beccaroon swooped down and sat on a thick branch wrapped with a leafless green creeper. The vine looked too much like a snake, so he hopped to another limb.<br>&#x201c;Was that wise?&#x201d; he asked.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so either, Bec, butwhat else can I do? I sell the artwork only as a last resort when we need quite a bit of cash. The well needs re-digging.&#x201d; Tipper pulled a tight face, looking like she&#x2019;d swallowed<br>nasty medicine. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve sold almost everything in the house. Mother sees our things in the market and buys them back. Sometimes I get a better price for a piece the second time I sell it, and sometimes not.&#x201d;<br>Beccaroon swayed back and forth on his feet, shaking his head. &#x201c;She never catches on?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Never.&#x201d; Tipper giggled. &#x201c;She shows remarkably consistent taste. When she spots something that was once ours, she buys it, brings it home, shows it off to me, and tells me she has always wanted something just like it. And she never notices pictures gone from the walls, rugs missing in rooms, chairs, tables, vases, candlesticks gone. I used to rearrange things to disguise a hole in the d�cor, but there&#x2019;s no need.&#x201d;<br>The sigh that followed her explanation held no joy.Tipper looked around. &#x201c;There never is a place to sit in this forest when one wants to plop down and have a good cry.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not the type to cry. I&#x2019;ll walk you home.&#x201d; Beccaroon hopped down to the path. His head came up to her waist. She immediately put her dainty hand on his topknot and smoothed the creamy plumes back.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the best of friends. Keeping this secret would be unbearable if I didn&#x2019;t have you to confide in.&#x201d;<br>Beccaroon clicked his tongue. &#x201c;No flattery, or I shall fly away.&#x201d;<br>They moseyed back the direction Tipper had come, opposite the way Hanner had departed.<br>Beccaroon tsked. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like that greasy fellow.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;Tipper gently twisted the longest feather from the center of Bec&#x2019;s crest around her forefinger.<br>The grand parrot jerked his head away and gave her his sternest glare. She was his girl, but he still wouldn&#x2019;t let her take liberties. She didn&#x2019;t seem to notice he was disgruntled, and that further blackened<br>his mood.<br>&#x201c;Hanner is all right, Bec. He takes the statues to Dodderbanoster. Dodderbanoster takes them to cities beyond my reach and gets a fair price for them. Sometimes I think the pouch Hanner brings back is<br>way too full.&#x201d;<br>Beccaroon clicked his tongue. &#x201c;Your father is a master artist. His work is worth a mighty price.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hanner says sometimes Dodderbanoster sells them to a dealer who takes them even farther away, to thriving districts.Wealthy patrons bid to own a Verrin Schope work of art.&#x201d; She held back a leafy branch<br>so Beccaroon could strut by with ease. &#x201c;Late at night when I sit inmy window and think, I hope that Papa will see one of his sculptures or paintings in a market in some far away metropolis. I imagine the scene. He exclaims with shock. He turns red and sputters and shakes his fists. In fact, he&#x2019;s so angry he comes straight home and yells loud and long at his daughter who dares to sell his masterpieces.&#x201d;<br>Beccaroon rolled his shoulders, causing his wings to tilt out, then settle against his sides. &#x201c;What of your mother? Does she ever mention your father&#x2019;s absence?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, why should she? He&#x2019;s been gone for years, but she still sees him. She talks to him every night after his workday is done. Promenades through the garden with him. Pours his tea, and just the other evening I heard her fussing at himfor not giving enoughmoney to the parish.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I suppose she dipped in the household funds to make up for his neglect.&#x201d;<br>Tipper sighed. &#x201c;Yes, she did.&#x201d;<br>They went on a ways in silence. Tipper picked a bloom, savored its spicy odor, then placed it behind one pointed ear. &#x201c;Mother has an idea in her head.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For anyone else, the head is a splendid place to keep an idea. For your mother, she should just let them go.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s determined to visit her sister.&#x201d; Tipper raised her eyebrows so that the upside-downV was even more pronounced. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll go if she manages to pack her long list of necessities. Some of the items are quite unreasonable.&#x201d;<br>Beccaroon snatched a nut from an open shell on the ground. He played the small nugget over his tongue, enjoying its sweetness, then swallowed. &#x201c;And you? Is she taking you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m to stay here and make sure Papa is comfortable and remembers to go to bed at night instead of working till all hours in his studio.&#x201d;<br><br></p><h2>Dragons Touch: Weaknesses of the Human Anatomy</h2><p>Drop your opponent in an instant with the deadly moves of the Dragon&#39;s Touch.

Since the early twentieth century some of the fiercest and most eloquent critiques of Israel and Zionism have been made by Jewish thinkers. They have hailed from political and intellectual traditions&#x2014;Zionism (Hannah Arendt), anti-Zionism (Maxim Rodinson), anarchism (Noam Chomsky), and Marxism (I. F. Stone). Unconditional supporters of the state of Israel have denounced them as heretics. Yet in the midst of the violence engulfing Palestine and Israel, their warnings about the Zionist project, with its vision of an ethnically pure Jewish state, have never seemed more prescient. These prophets outcast speak out as individuals in a wilderness, proposing solutions to the question of Palestine that range from a two-state solution to socialist internationalism. What links them is an understanding that Israeli policies have been a disaster not only for Palestinians, but for Jews as well. As Jews, they express a recognition of the tragic thread that connects the Palestinian catastrophe to the Holocaust, the destruction of European Jewry that made Israel possible, and that led many Jews to view Zionism as their only salvation.</p><p></p><h2>Fantastic Creatures of Edward J Detmold</h2><p>softcover</p><p></p><h2>Inside SEAL Team Six: My Life and Missions with America&#39;s Elite Warriors</h2><p><i>The Inside Story of America's Ultimate Warriors</i><br><br> When Osama bin Laden was assassinated, the entire world was fascinated by the men who had completed the seemingly impossible mission that had dogged the U.S. government for over a decade. SEAL Team 6 became synonymous with heroism, duty, and justice. Only a handful of the elite men who make up the SEALs, the US Navy's best and bravest, survive the legendary and grueling selection process that leads to becoming a member of Team 6, a group so classified it technically does not even exist. There are no better warriors on Earth. <br><br>Don Mann knows what it takes to be a brother in this ultra-selective fraternity. As a member of Seal Team Six for over eight years and a SEAL for over seventeen years, he worked in countless covert operations, operating from land, sea, and air, and facing shootings, decapitations, and stabbings. He was captured by the enemy and lived to tell the tale, and he participated in highly classified missions all over the globe, including Somalia, Panama, El Salvador, Colombia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. As a coordinator for several civilian SEAL training programs, and as a former Training Officer of SEAL Team Six, he was directly responsible for shaping the bodies and minds of SEALs who carried out the assassination of Osama bin Laden. <br><br>But to become a SEAL, Mann had to overcome his own troubled childhood and push his body to its breaking point--and beyond. INSIDE SEAL TEAM 6 is a high octane narrative of physical and mental toughness, giving unprecedented insight to the inner workings of the training and secret missions of the world's most respected and feared combat unit.</p><p><b>Don Mann</b> (CWO3, USN) has for the last thirty years been associated with the Navy SEALS either as a platoon member, assault team member, boat crew leader, or advanced training officer; and more recently program director preparing civilians to go to BUD/s (SEAL Training). Up until 1998 he was on active duty with SEAL Team 6. Since his retirement, he has deployed to the Middle East on numerous occasions in support of the war against terrorism. Many of the active duty SEALs on SEAL Team 6 are the same guys he taught how to shoot, conduct ship and aircraft takedowns, and trained in urban, arctic, desert, and river and jungle warfare, as well as Close Quarters Battle (CQB) and Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT). He has suffered two broken backs, two cases of high altitude pulmonary edema, and multiple other broken bones, in training or service.

Viret Perna!! (Green Eggs and Ham in Latin)</h2><p>C'mon! Try them, in Latin. Sam-I-am's smiling enthusiasm for the seemingly unappetizingly tinted green eggs and ham is undaunted, despite repeated disdain shown by an unnamed, dour disparager. Sam will not give up, though, and offers the dish over and over, proposing that it be sampled under sometimes whacky circumstances and in odd locales (with a goat, on a boat, in the rain, on a train, in a box, with a fox, etc.). In the end Sam does get the grumpy disparager to take a taste- only to get Sam off his back. The disparager's demeanor quickly changes to all smiles when he discovers to his surprise that disdained green eggs and ham are, in fact, quite tasty. Sam-I-am, yet another delightfully plucky Seuss protagonist, allows both adults and humans to look - -with the objectivity humor so adeptly affords - at our all-too-human tendency towards knee-jerk negativity in response to anything that is new or different. Special Features Dr. Seuss' perennial favorite, Green Eggs and Ham, is here rendered in spirited Latin: in trochaic rhythm with rhyme in the last two syllables, a sprightly verse-form that goes toe-to-toe with Seuss's whimsical drawings. Virent Ova! Viret Perna!! is a true delight - Latin as it is infrequently experienced: fun, exhilarating, ebullient.

Chambliss, a sociology professor at Hamilton College in New York, observes that coaches determine their level of achievement by choosing their level of expectations, and that Schubert, for one, expects nothing but the best, demanding complete dedication to the sport and rigorous training. The author focuses on four swimmers in the Olympic year of 1984, all of whom acquitted themselves brilliantly, and provides details on the techniques they used to develop excellence. Of special interest is an epilogue previewing those who will be swimming in Seoul this year and assessing their prospects. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Chambliss has written neither a technical manual nor a glorifying memoir, but instead presents a "news-reelish" coverage of a sport that will appeal to the general reader rather than to swimming enthusiasts only. In a conversational style, he highlights the career development of such Olympic swimmers as Mike O'Brien, Dara Torres, Rowdy Gaines, and Mary Meagher under the direction of coach Mark Schubert. In attempting to portray the human quality of the athletes and coaches, Chambliss dips freely into their private lives. The book has been published to coincide with the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.

David Nash, defense attorney -- cool, unruffled, practically unbeatable in the courtroom. Most of his clients are guilty. A few may be monsters.<br><br> Suddenly the Ice Man is assailed by doubts and unanswerable questions. What is the cost of each victory, each rapist or murderer set free -- to society and to Nash's soul?<br><br> Then comes a case that may be Nash's redemption. A client whose innocence he can believe in, a rising lawyer and family man accused of the brual murder of an undercover vice cop. But as the case moves toward trial, new doubts grip him: What is truth and what is carefully fabricated falsehood? Is Nash, a a master at handling juries, being manipulated himself? And by whom? By the time Nash's perfect case is finished, the questions become a matter of life and death.</p><p>"Jampacked plot...

Doubting whether the American experiment in equality could work, the author conjectured that democracy would erect a society that would succumb to a different type of tyranny than that of a monarchy or aristocracy - that of the majority.</p><p></p><h2>V for Vendetta</h2><p>V for Vendetta is, like its author&#39;s later Watchmen, a landmark in comic-book writing. Alan Moore has led the field in intelligent, politically astute (if slightly paranoid), complex adult comic-book writing since the early 1980s. He began V back in 1981 and it constituted one of his first attempts (along with the criminally neglected but equally superb Miracleman) at writing an ongoing series. It is 1998 (which was the future back then!) and a Fascist government has taken over the U.K. The only blot on its particular landscape is a lone terrorist who is systematically killing all the government personnel associated with a now destroyed secret concentration camp. Codename V is out for vengeance ... and an awful lot more. V feels slightly dated like all past premonitions do. The original series was black and white and that added to the grittiness of the feel while the coloring here in the graphic novel sometimes blurs David Lloyd&#39;s fine drawing. But these are small concerns. Skillfully plotted, V is an essential read for all those who love comics and the freedom, as a medium, they allow a writer as skilled as Moore. --Mark Thwaite</p><p><b>Alan Moore</b> is perhaps the most acclaimed writer in the graphic story medium, having garnered countless awards for works such as <i>Watchmen, V for Vendetta, Swamp Thing</i> and <i>Miracleman</i>. He is also the mastermind behind the America's Best Comics line, through which he has created (along with many talented illustrators) <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Promethea, Tom Strong, Tomorrow Stories</i> and <i>Top Ten</i>.<br><br><b>David Lloyd</b> has been working in comics since 1977. Amongst his most favored works are <i>Sl�ine: Cauldron of Blood, Night Raven: House of Cards, Aliens: Glass Corridor, Weird War Tales</i>, <i>Gangland</i>,<i> Dark Horse Presents 86, The Horrorist, Marlowe: The Graphic Novel</i>, <i>Hellblazer: Rare Cuts, War Story: J For Jenny, War Story: Nightingale,</i> and <i>Kickback</i>.Grade 9 Up&#x2013;The date is November 5th, 1997. War has ravaged England, entire races have been eradicated, the entire British populace is under constant surveillance, and the absolute power is absolutely corrupt. On this historic day, a man with a strong resemblance to Guy Fawkes (in action and dress) blows up Parliament. The bomber, a masked character named V, saves a girl named Eve from a violent crime and takes her under his wing. Moore's dystopian, fascist version of England, ruled by one central leader and his sects (named after parts of the body, such as Finger, Nose, and Voice), is systematically dismantled by the enigmatic V. Readers must ultimately decide if V is a mad anarchist/terrorist or a freedom-fighting avenger for good. Originally published in 1989, <i>V</i> has been reissued as a hardcover book with never-seen-before sketches and two new vignettes. This story is slated to be released as a major motion picture in 2006, and demand should intensify as the movie trailers come out. Combining alternate history with moral questions about freedom and identity, this book would work well in a school setting; and while there is some slight nudity and violence, they fit well within the framework of the story.<i>&#x2013;Jennifer Feigelman, Plattekill Public Library, Modena, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

More than ten years after their break-up in 1981, they returned to remind fans of how sorely they had missed their elegance and erudition, subsequently recording&nbsp;Two Against Nature&nbsp;and Everything Must Go&nbsp;during the following decade, touring continuously, and being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.Major Dudes collects some of the smartest and wittiest interviews Becker and Fagen have ever given, along with insightful reviews of&#x2015;and commentary on&#x2015;their extraordinary songs. Compiled by leading music critic and writer Barney Hoskyns, Major Dudes features contributions from Chris Van Ness, Steven Rosen, and the late Robert Palmer, and pieces including rare interviews and reviews of Steely Dan&#x2019;s early albums from Disc, Melody Maker, and Rolling Stone.With an afterword examining the musical legacy of and memorializing the late Walter Becker, who since his passing Rolling Stone has heralded as the &#x201c;brilliant perfectionist behind one of rock&#x2019;s most eccentric bands,&#x201d; Major Dudes is the most comprehensive anthology of Steely Dan ever compiled and will be the centerpiece on every fan&#x2019;s shelf.</p><p><b>Barney Hoskyns </b>is the cofounder and editorial director of <i>Rock&#x2019;s Backpages</i>, and author of numerous books including <i>Across the Great Divide</i>, <i>Waiting for the Sun</i>, <i>Hotel California</i>, and <i>Lowside of the Road</i>.

Hoskyns arranges <em>Major Dudes</em> to bring attention to some of the more talented writers who have tangled with the notoriously prickly duo, as well as to act as a companion to the band's music.

What better recommendation could there be for a book about music?&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;What enthralled me, and still does, is how the Dan&#x2019;s happily seditious lyrics are wed to the complexity of the music. Most of the writers here understand that. . . . Becker and Fagen were notoriously tough interview subjects, and didn&#x2019;t grant audiences often, so Hoskyns has managed to corral the best of the best. The pair&#x2019;s biting humor comes across in the finest moments. . . .

For a Dan fan, it&#x2019;s fascinating to read about what the critics were hearing, which was a combination of baffled satisfaction, baffled ambivalence, and baffled displeasure. One thing that is consistent . . . is how different the Dan sounded from everything and everyone else. . . . Hoskyns has judiciously gathered a lot of perceptive thinking, especially admirable because of how unmusical most rock critics are and how complex the Dan&#x2019;s music is.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>George Grella, <em>The Brooklyn Rail</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A comprehensive overview and history of a unique American rock band.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A collection of some of the wittiest interviews Fagen and Becker have ever sat down for juxtaposed with a collection of the sharpest commentary from music journalism&#x2019;s top dogs.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Melissa Caruso, <em>Elmore Magazine</em></strong></p><h2>Hungry Ghosts</h2><p>Combining years of interviews, extensive research, and painstaking detective work, a journalist exposes the horrible result of Mao Zedong&#39;s attempted utopian engineering in China between 1958 and 1962, uncovering a bloody trail of terror, cannibalism, torture, and murder. 12,500 first printing.</p><p>This first authoritative expose of the 1958-1962 famine prompted by China&#39;s collectivization plan, &#34;The Great Leap Forward,&#34; comes at a time when the cult of Mao is alive and well inside China, and while agents of Chinese influence are able to arrange audiences with a President. Via his painstaking research and reporting that included two treks through interior Chinese provinces, Becker tells how the famine occurred because ill-trained peasants were forced to undertake a gigantic and centralized industrial and agricultural expansion. The new factories, canals, and irrigation systems failed spectacularly, and in contrast to propaganda boasts of having economically outstripped the U.S., when in reality the populace was driven by starvation to cannibalism, slavery, and madness.<p><b>Jasper Becker</b> is currently Beijing bureau chief for the<i> South China Morning Post.</i> He has also written extensively on Chinese affairs for <i>The Guardian, The Economist, </i>and <i>The Spectato</i>r.

How do I find the tribal roll that lists her name?" Lennon (Florida's Unfortunates) explains that problems often arise in this type of research because family tradition doesn't match the time when the Native American ancestor actually lived and because many obscure resources go unexplored. A healthy start to avoiding such problems is to research the family outside of the Indian tradition, learning as much as possible about the customs and political realities of the area where the ancestor resided. Focusing on the Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast (the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole), Lennon details the often-overlooked resources in U.S. and international archives covering the years prior to the tribes' removal to Indian Territory. She notes that many early white interactions with tribes came in the form of trade or religious instruction and emphasizes that researchers should investigate all extant records related to those endeavors, as well as slave-related records for those of African-Indian descent. She also overviews the popular federal records (such as the Guion Miller Enrollment Records) and discusses valuable but obscure federal records. Reference notes and an index round out the book, but it is the excellent bibliography that readers should closely peruse as it lists histories, memoirs, archival guides, manuscript collections, and record transcriptions that could add historical and cultural depth to one's research. Other helpful general guides such as the Native American Genealogical Sourcebook focus on familiar records, but Lennon's book provides guidance in an area of research not well addressed in the current literature and is therefore highly recommended for public and genealogical libraries.

He bought over six hundred Japanese prints and displayed them in his studio as inspiration.</p><p>Van Gogh admired the prints&#x2019; mastery of strong colors, everyday subjects, unusual spatial effects, and delicate details from nature.

Three sequels followed this popular novel--<i>The Return of the Indian</i>, <i>The Secret of the Indian</i>, and <i>The Mystery of the Cupboard</i>--and <i>The Key to the Indian</i> is next in line. At first Omri was alone with his secret of the toy figures and the surprising appearance of the 18th-century Iroquois Little Bear. One day, however, his father finds the figures in his son's room, and locks them in the special cupboard: "Of course they'd come to life inside, and his dad had put a lot of twos and twos from the past together, and <i>realized</i>. And later he'd seen them, been introduced to them. And accepted it.... It took a special kind of grownup not only to accept magic when he saw it but to promise and swear that he'd never, ever tell a living soul." What Omri and his father both now know about is the terrible plight of the Iroquois people during the 18th century--and that Omri's new friend Little Bear is in urgent need of help. Father and son attempt to travel back in time... but things go horribly wrong. They persist for the sake of Little Bear, but at great risk. With history, magic, humor, and all the surprising twists readers have come to expect from Banks, <i>The Key to the Indian</i> will absorb young readers through the very last page.

His mission is to bring the planet back into the fold of an evolving galactic civilization, but to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own culture and prejudices and those that he encounters. On a planet where people are of no gender--or both--this is a broad gulf indeed. The inventiveness and delicacy with which Le Guin portrays her alien world are not only unusual and inspiring, they are fundamental to almost all decent science fiction that has been written since. In fact, reading Le Guin again may cause the eye to narrow somewhat disapprovingly at the younger generation: what new ground are they breaking that is not already explored here with greater skill and acumen? It cannot be said, however, that this is a rollicking good story. Le Guin takes a lot of time to explore her characters, the world of her creation, and the philosophical themes that arise.<p> If there were a canon of classic science fiction, <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> would be included without debate. Certainly, no science fiction bookshelf may be said to be complete without it. But the real question: is it fun to read? It is science fiction of an earlier time, a time that has not worn particularly well in the genre. <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> was a groundbreaking book in 1969, a time when, like the rest of the arts, science fiction was awakening to new dimensions in both society and literature. But the first excursions out of the pulp tradition are sometimes difficult to reread with much enjoyment. Rereading <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i>, decades after its publication, one feels that those who chose it for the Hugo and Nebula awards were right to do so, for it truly does stand out as one of the great books of that era. It is immensely rich in timeless wisdom and insight.</p><p> <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> is science fiction for the thinking reader, and should be read attentively in order to properly savor the depth of insight and the subtleties of plot and character. It is one of those pleasures that requires a little investment at the beginning, but pays back tenfold with the joy of raw imagination that resonates through the subsequent 30 years of science fiction storytelling. Not only is the bookshelf incomplete without owning it, so is the reader without having read it. <i>--L.

Cramer, cofounder of <i>TheStreet.com,</i> radio and television commentator, and for years one of Wall Street's premier money managers, takes readers on a no-holds-barred tour of life on Wall Street �revealing how the game is played, who breaks the rules, and who gets hurt.<br><br>Everyone on Wall Street knows Jim Cramer, and Cramer knows Wall Street better than anyone. For fifteen years he ran Cramer, Berkowitz, one of the Street's most successful hedge funds with a compounded annual return of 24% after all fees. In <i>Confessions of a Street Addict</i> he takes us from his fascination with the stock market as a middle-class kid in the Philadelphia suburbs to Harvard, where he began managing money. After an apprenticeship at Goldman, Sachs, Cramer set out on his own with his wife, Karen, the "Trading Goddess," as his partner. Cramer brilliantly describes the life of a money manager -- the frenetic pace, the constant pressure to outperform the market and other fund managers, and the shark-like attacks fund managers make as they circle a fund perceived to be in trouble.<br> <br>At the same time that he was managing money, Cramer was one of the best-known commentators on the financial markets. A former president of the Harvard <i>Crimson,</i> Cramer had been a newspaper reporter before he began managing money. While he was a fund manager, he wrote for <i>SmartMoney</i> and other publications, making him one of the first money managers to offer insight and analysis from inside the world of finance. With the rise of the Internet and online publishing, he co-founded <i>TheStreet.com,</i> the online financial Web site. In one of the most fascinating chapters in this book, Cramer takes us inside the IPO of <i>TheStreet.com,</i> where he found himself a knowledgeable but helpless onlooker as his own Web site came on the market at an unrealistically high price that it never reached again, a harbinger of the dot-com disasters that would soon haunt the stock market.<br> <br>Throughout the book Cramer is characteristically outspoken, outrageous, and candid about everyone, himself included. There has never been a high-wired, high-octane book about Wall Street like this one.</p><p>It's hard to think of anyone more intense or opinionated, or who wears as many hats as James Cramer. In <i>Confessions of a Street Addict</i>, the man who first made a name for himself on Wall Street successfully managing his hedge fund--and then became famous on Main Street with his manic appearances on CNBC--tells the improbable story of his career as journalist, Wall Street pundit, Internet entrepreneur, and television commentator. For the most part, Cramer manages to avoid the self-congratulatory hype that mars so many books of this ilk; in fact, what makes <i>Confessions</i> so compelling are the shots that Cramer takes at himself, be it his now infamous capitulation during the stock market panic of October 1998, when he wrote a piece for TheStreet.com advising readers of an impending crash just as the market began to rebound, or the callous way he treated so many around him in pursuit of the next trade. Here's an informative, honest, and rollicking read for fans of CNBC, TheStreet.com, or anyone who has ever lost sleep thinking about their portfolios. Highly recommended. <i>--Harry C.

If you can fight past an initial uncertainty about the identity of its narrators, you may find that it&#x2019;s the best thing you&#x2019;ve read in years. This first novel by acclaimed short-story-writer and essayist George Saunders (<em>Tenth of December</em>, <em>The Brain-Dead Megaphone</em>) will upend your expectations of what a novel should be. Saunders has said that &#x201c;Lincoln in the Bardo&#x201d; began as a play, and that sense of a drama gradually revealing itself through disparate voices remains in the work&#x2019;s final form. </p> <p>The year is 1862. President Lincoln, already tormented by the knowledge that he&#x2019;s responsible for the deaths of thousands of young men on the battlefields of the Civil War, loses his beloved eleven-year-old son, Willie, to typhoid. The plot begins after Willie is laid to rest in a cemetery near the White House, where, invisible to the living, ghosts linger, unwilling to relinquish this world for the next. Their bantering conversation, much of it concerned with earthly -- and earthy &#x2013; pleasures, counterbalances Lincoln&#x2019;s abject sorrow. </p> Saunders takes huge risks in this novel, and they pay off. His writing is virtuosic &#x2013; and best of all, its highs and lows are profoundly entertaining. You may hear echoes of Thornton Wilder, Beckett and even a little Chaucer, but <em>Lincoln in the Bardo</em> is peculiar and perfect unto itself. Some advice: don&#x2019;t try to read this one in a library. You&#x2019;ll be hooting with laughter when you aren&#x2019;t wiping away your tears. <em>--Sarah Harrison Smith, The Amazon Book Review</em>George Saunders is the author of nine books, including Lincoln in the Bardo, winner of the 2017 Man Booker Prize and the Premio Rezzori prize. Tenth of December was a finalist for the National Book Award and won the inaugural Folio Prize. He has received MacArthur and Guggenheim fellowships and the PEN/Malamud Prize for excellence in the short story, and was recently elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Her incomparable vision, consummate skill, and bighearted spirit have earned her consistent comparisons to Anton Chekhov, John Updike, Alice Munro, Grace Paley, and Frank O'Connor. Her latest work, gathered in this stunning collection of twenty new stories, is an occasion for celebration.<br><br>Pearlman writes with warmth about the predicaments of being human. The title story involves an affair, an illegitimate pregnancy, anorexia, and adolescent drug use, but the true excitement comes from the evocation of the interior lives of young Emily Knapp, who wishes she were a bug, and her inner circle. "The Golden Swan" transports the reader to a cruise ship with lavish buffets-and a surprise stowaway-while the lead story, "Tenderfoot," follows a widowed pedicurist searching for love with a new customer anguishing over his own buried trauma. Whether the characters we encounter are a special child with pentachromatic vision, a group of displaced Somali women adjusting to life in suburban Boston, or a staid professor of Latin unsettled by a random invitation to lecture on the mystery of life and death, Pearlman knows each of them intimately and reveals them to us with unsurpassed generosity.<br>In prose as knowing as it is poetic, Pearlman shines a light on small, devastatingly precise moments to reflect the beauty and grace found in everyday life. Both for its artistry and for the recognizable lives of the characters it renders so exquisitely and compassionately, <i>Honeydew </i>is a collection that will pull readers back time and again. These stories are a crowning achievement for a brilliant career and demonstrate once more that Pearlman is a master of the form whose vision is unfailingly wise and forgiving.<br></p><p>Edith Pearlman's previous collection, <i>Binocular Vision,</i> won the National Book Critics Circle Award and was a finalist for the National Book Award as well as the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the Story Prize. She is the author of three other story collections. She has also received the PEN/Malamud Award for excellence in the short story and her stories have been reprinted in <i>The Best American Short Stories, The O.

In the early years of my academic career, Richard Muller's dictionary was the very first to attain such esteemed status. Not only is it a repository of information impossible to find so quickly anywhere else, it is just a darn good read. It's a primer of Latin syntax and at the same time a sophisticated introduction to careful theology. It's a thrill to see it newly improved, some thirty years later! Serious students of Latin, serious students of theology, and--frankly--serious students of clear thought will be in Richard's debt for another generation to come. Well done!"<br>--<b>John&nbsp;L. Thompson</b>, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"If one of the most well-read theologians of his generation presents a dictionary, one has high expectations, and Richard Muller does not disappoint! Besides more common terms, one also finds here lucid explanations of rarer scholastic expressions, so that even the specialist will learn and profit from this book. This is a must-have for students and professors and for everybody who studies the Christian tradition."<br>--<b>Ulrich&nbsp;L. Lehner</b>, Marquette University<br><br>"Few theological resources offer as much insight and useful information as Muller's dictionary. I regularly encourage my students to buy this book and read it cover to cover! This is more than a reference occasionally to be consulted; it is a key to unlocking the riches of classic Reformed theology. I highly recommend this book to students, pastors, and scholars--to anyone who wants a deeper understanding of the historic Protestant faith."<br>--<b>J.&nbsp;V.

By and large, they weren't. But Monet's rare small paintings of flowers were snapped up by contemporary collectors. And several artists who exhibited with the impressionists, influenced them, or were influenced by them--including Manet, van Gogh, Gauguin, and C�zanne--devoted a sizable portion of their oeuvre to the genre. While <i>Impressionist Still Life</i> is a somewhat misleading title--yet another marketing ploy to attract lovers of a popular style, it seems--this book makes a good case for the importance of this intimate genre of painting to major themes and techniques of later-19th-century art. Published in conjunction with an exhibition of the same name at the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. (September 22, 2001, to January 13, 2002, then traveling to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), this volume is lavishly illustrated and rich in detailed information. Five essays trace themes ranging from the influence of 18th-century painter Jean-Baptiste Chardin on still-life composition and the use of color to the strikingly modern way C�zanne's famous apples devalued subject matter to emphasize the physicality of brush strokes. The stunning paintings featured in full-page plates include some rarely seen canvases, such as Monet's <i>Jar of Peaches</i> from 1866. In this tour de force of illusionism, the flattened look of peaches packed in a glass jar contrasts with fuzzy whole peaches that cast reflections on a marble table scribbled with bold white veins. A genre that could encompass both the luminous intimacy of Eva Gonzal�s' <i>White Shoes</i> and the restless drama of C�zanne's <i>Still Life with Ginger Jar and Eggplants</i> turned out to be uniquely suited to individual perceptions of modern life. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i>Exhibition Schedule: The Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.: Sept. 22, 2001-Jan. 13,2002; The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston: Feb. 17, 2002-June 9, 2002 <br>Publicity: National publicity tie-in with Phillips Collection exhibition; National magazine and newspaper coverage <br>Advertising: Art magazines, regional booksellers' catalogues</p><h2>Gracious Uncertainty: Faith in the Second Half of Life</h2><p>Gracious Uncertainty: Faith in the Second Half of Life reflects on issues concerning everyone but which intensify as we grow older: loving more fully, dealing with loss, finding consolation, and having the courage to gaze (even while shaking inwardly) at the nearing reality of death. Jane Sigloh is a guide both witty and wise. She blends personal stories, Scriptural insights, and lessons drawn from years in ministry into insightful reflections on the beauty and challenges of aging. Gracious Uncertainty is an intimate, at times humorous, and often spirit-provoking guide through the unknowns of the later years.</p><p>Jane Sigloh is a retired Episcopal priest who lives in Charlottesville, Virginia. She is the author of Like Trees Walking: In the Second Half of Life and a beloved speaker on topics of faith and aging.In simple, yet lyrical prose, Sigloh, a retired Episcopal priest, ponders a variety of existential and theological questions related to aging. Short chapters typically begin with descriptions of experiences, such as &#x2018;When my mother was in her eighties, she started putting things in little plastic bags,&#x2019; which then unfold into a reflections on, for example, the longing for certainty: &#x2018;Sometimes I wish I were a fundamentalist.&#x2019; Drawing inspiration from a range of sources, such as quantum physics, Joseph Campbell, poetry, movies, scripture, and her own personal experiences, Sigloh creates indelible images, as with her story of falling out of a boat into rapids after catching a fish and stubbornly clinging to the rod. Elsewhere she conveys how a church sanctuary stripped of its religious imagery on Maundy Thursday evoked the raw emotional wounds caused by her son&#x2019;s death. Questions for reflection and discussion, such as &#x2018;How has your name influenced your life?&#x2019; offer thought-provoking prompts on each chapter&#x2019;s topic. Sigloh is an honest, intelligent, and companionable guide for readers wishing to bring grace into the process of aging. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Jane Sigloh validates the statement, "God made human beings, because he loves stories." Her stories and reflections are personal, but as Carl Rogers says, "that which is most personal is most universal." Jane's memories and reflections are woven into a practical theology, and they are a sound basis to finding a footing in life's second half. In this book, Jane Sigloh extends a certain graciousness to the reader. (J. Pittman McGehee, Episcopal priest, Jungian analyst, and author of The Invisible Church: Finding Faith Where You Are)<br><br>Jane Sigloh is a woman of faith who can turn a phrase into poetry. In Gracious Uncertainty, she exudes a childlike naivet� in God&#x2019;s creative embrace. Sigloh rests comfortably in the divine realm of ambiguity, a place where doubt strengthens faith. Her belief in the marvels of new physics strengthens foundational science where discovery lends relevance to scripture. Sigloh&#x2019;s theology above all bespeaks an elevated consciousness of awe and wonder. (Randall B. Robertson, founding director, GladdeningLight)<br><br>This book is gracious indeed, and very helpful amid all the puzzlements of getting older. It will strengthen and delight not only those of us well into the second half of life, but also the next generation&#x2014;perhaps these pages will help them make sense of us! (Barbara Cawthorne Crafton, Episcopal priest, head of The Geranium Farm, and author of The Courage to Grow Old)<br><br>Jane Sigloh&#x2019;s Gracious Uncertainty seems like a sure bet to me. She has the wisdom that comes (if lucky) &#x201c;at a certain age,&#x201d; but a youthful spirit that doesn't settle for received wisdom or a stock response. She investigates experience across her own lifetime to share both what she has come to understand and what remains a mystery. The Bible is her companion throughout but by no means her only inspiration. Best of all, she makes you want to keep better track of yourself. God may be beyond knowing, but what are the hints and guesses that come to us if, like her, we pay attention to our lives? (Peter S.

When they are inevitably invaded by forces of nature and decay, they become suggestive of an alternative literary universe. Noted photographer and collage artist Rosamond Purcell has been exploring this universe for the past thirty years, and in this extraordinarily beautiful collection, the first retrospective of her work, her images teach us to read in a new way. Here are two conjoined volumes transformed by a nesting mouse into a heap of disrupted plot and straw; a 19th century French economics text re-interpreted by foraging termites, and many other oddities from a fertile imagination. <i>Bookworm</i>'s 125 color reproductions are imaginative evidence of those processes that render literal meaning irrelevant.</p><p><b>Rosamond Purcell</b> is known for her collaborations with Stephen Jay Gould, often in conjunction with natural history museums, including <i>Illuminations, Finders Keepers</i> and <i>Strange Cases</i>. The official photographer of the Mutter Collection, her work has been exhibited at major museums nationwide, and is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, The Philadelphia Museum of Art, The National Academy of Science, and The Victoria and Albert in London, among many others.Steadfast readers recoil from the term <i>bookworm,</i> not wanting to be aligned with insects that destroy the books they feed on. But artist Purcell is fascinated by the patterns paper-eating insects create. Renowned for her provocative improvisations on the collections of natural history museums and the obsessions of private collectors, Purcell makes images and collages that reveal the taboo beauty of dissolution and decay. In 125 startlingly complex works of many strata, extraordinary textures, luminous colors, and unforeseen juxtapositions, Purcell considers the vulnerability of books to the transforming powers of water, fire, gravity, organisms, and time. And she channels the aura of mystery and sanctity surrounding objects taken from tombs, shipwrecks, and abandoned buildings. Ruins were sublime to the Romantics, and Purcell concurs, achieving a Joseph Cornell-like magic, albeit more worldly. With a suitably sophisticated essay by Sven Birkerts and Purcell's own delightfully revealing introduction, this inquiry into the life cycle of objects, the metamorphosing powers of nature, and the timelessness of art is a mind-expanding experience. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This re-release of Different Children, Different Needs clarifies what the Bible means when it commands us to "train up a child in the way he should go" (Proverbs 22:6). It teaches moms and dads how to understand the personality God has given each of their children and how to tailor their parenting styles to meet their children's needs. Pastor Charles Boyd uses the popular DISC personality assessment model to help parents better recognize, accept, and appreciate their kids' temperaments.<br><br>IF ONLY YOUR PARENTS HAD READ THIS BOOK... <br><br>Do you know whether your child is determined, influencing, soft-hearted, or conscientious? <br><br>The key to effective parenting is knowing what motivates your child. <br><br>The information and tools provided in <i>Different Children, Different Needs</i> will take the mystery out of the way you interact with each other. You'll begin to realize things you never understood about the best way to relate to each unique son or daughter. <br><br>Your children will come to realize how God has designed and gifted them, growing in confidence and finding a sense of belonging. And you'll enjoy the fulfilling parenting experience you've always wished for.<br><br><b>Story Behind the Book</b><br><br>Based on the biblical teaching of Proverbs 22:6, the principles in this book can become the backbone for everything you do as a parent. If you don't practice the "big picture" principle presented in <i>Different Children, Different Needs</i> , your kids will be negatively affected. But if you take Proverbs 22:6 seriously and seek to apply what you find in this book, your children will come to understand how God has designed and gifted them. They will grow to have both a sense of confidence and a sense of belonging. Just when you master the art of parenting one child, here comes another&#x2014;and they're "different as night and day." You must learn how to tailor your own unique parenting style to meet your children's special needs more effectively. <br><br>This simple resource helps you understand, accept, appreciate, and enjoy your children...and their God-given temperaments.</p><p>Dr. Charles F.

For all that, C.S. Lewis loved the Comedy for its seemingly effortless poetry.<p></p><p>In this guide Peter Leithart uses a biblical angle to open up the <i>Comedy</i> for students, high school and up. He begins his discussion by examining the meaning and place of the courtly love tradition and then introduces us to the varied levels of meaning throughout the work.

"Many practitioners begin to realize after some time there is 'something else' to be discovered in Yoga that speaks to our universal desire for meaning," she says. While the daily exercises are tuning the physical body into shape, mystical awareness begins to emerge."<p> This awareness can be focused and honed by abiding by ethical tenets, explained in this book, that are intended to help the yoga practitioner attain personal growth, confidence, and a sense of well-being. In fact, Christensen writes, the movements of yoga were developed <i>after</i> the guidelines, in order to maintain the body's health while the practitioner worked toward a higher state of spiritual awareness. Christensen illustrates these tenets, including nonviolence, truthfulness, purity, tolerance, and remembrance, with colorful anecdotes. For example, she once spoke about yoga at a heavy-equipment manufacturing company in southern Ohio. She brought up the celibacy tenet, how it differs from abstinence, and how it's best to start to incorporate it into your life slowly. She advised those in the audience to try not to think about sex for five minutes at a time. One intrigued audience member said, "Geez, can you imagine how restful that would be--five minutes of not thinking about broads?"</p><p> Even if you start out by making subtle changes, the guidelines for living suggested in this book are bound to bring about dramatic change. It's a sort of <i>Power Yoga</i> for the mind, crossed with a simple-living guide, and written by a true sage. For anyone looking to reach a state of self-actualization and empowerment, Christensen's forged a fine path. <i>--Erica Jorgensen</i></p>"Most people associate Yoga with the physical postures and movements that are taught in classes or learned from books. The physical aspect of Yoga, however, is only a small part of the great body of thought and technique that is the tradition of Yoga. In fact, the physical exercises and breathing techniques were originally designed simply to keep the body strong and healthy so that the practitioner could more easily reach for some deeper aspects of Yoga. <p>Many practitioners begin to realize after some time that there is "something else" to be discovered in Yoga that speaks to our universal desire for meaning. While the daily exercises are tuning the physical body into shape, mystical awareness begins to emerge. This happens most often when the ethical practices of Yoga, which are detailed in this book, are combined with the physical routines. Often, feelings of inner strength, self-confidence, and inner peace begin to emerge as this other aspect of Yoga starts to reveal itself."</p></p><h2>The Silkworm : Cormoran Strike Book 2</h2><p><p><b><i>'Teems with sly humour, witty asides and intelligence ...

Through a psychological interpretation of these fantasies, which consisted in the subliminal elaboration of forgotten memories, Th�odore Flournoy vastly extended the scope and understanding of the unconscious, and in particular, of its creative and mythopoetic capacities.

This book, as entertaining as a novel by Jules Verne or H. G. Wells, is a deep-reaching analysis of some of the subtle processes of the subconscious mind.

If I press too hard against the geese, they honk and peck at me, and even though my coat is too thick for it to hurt, it makes me want to cry. If I press too hard against the goat, she eats my plaits. One is already ten centimeters shorter than the other, the ribbon gone, and that makes me want to cry too.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I could stand up, but the boat is rolling and tumbling so much that I would probably fall over, and the deck is covered in water and poo and ?sh guts. If I don&#x2019;t fall over, I might bump into one of the ?shermen, and they are already grumpy about having a ten-year-old on their boat. They think it is bad luck to have a child onboard. Even worse luck if she is a girl.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I could go and sit with the old man and his seasick pig, but he might ask me why I am traveling alone, all the way from Copenhagen out to the island of Bornholm, and I don&#x2019;t want to talk about it. That will de?nitely make me want to cry.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I tell myself that the goat isn&#x2019;t so bad. She stinks, but she is friendly, and doesn&#x2019;t seem to mind my being close. The softness and warmth of her remind me of snuggling by the ?re with Mama, listening as she reads my favorite stories. I wrap my red woolen scarf around my head to protect my hair, rest my cheek against the goat, and close my eyes. A tear squeezes its way out from between my eyelids and dribbles down my face.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Silly,&#x201d; I say, licking it o? my cheek as it slides near to my mouth.<br> &nbsp;<br> I will not feel sorry for myself.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;I will be a brave girl,&#x201d; I whisper into the goat&#x2019;s kidneys. &#x201c;I will make Mama proud of me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And then I fall asleep.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> My grandmother meets me at the harbor at Svaneke. We have never met before, but I know it is her because she is the only woman there. She is short and round, like a barrel. Everything she wears is black&#x2014;her headscarf, dress, boots, and shawl. Even her eyes are black, like two raisins pressed into her wrinkled gray face. She does not smile.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I wonder if her bloomers are black. Gloomy underwear would be enough to wipe the joy from anyone&#x2019;s face.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;She waits on solid ground and makes me walk alone, down the gangplank and the full length of the long stone wharf. I have traveled all this way on my own, and still she makes me complete the ?nal part of the journey alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I feel naked and lopsided, and when I reach her, I realize why.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Grandmother gasps. &#x201c;What have you done to your hair, child?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I touch my head and feel spiky tufts where one of my long blond plaits used to sit. The goat has eaten all the hair o? one side of my head while I was asleep.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I can feel hot tears prickling in my eyes, but I will not let them fall. I will <i>not</i> feel sorry for myself. No matter how bald the right side of my head feels. No matter how much I wish my mother were here. No matter how long it takes before my grandmother hugs me and says that she is glad to meet me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Stay here, child,&#x201d; she says, and walks along the wharf to boss some men about. I have brought an enormous trunk with me and she is not happy. It will have to come later on the back of a cart. She will have to pay someone for their trouble.<br> &nbsp;<br> She means I have caused her trouble.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I think, <i>Don&#x2019;t hold your breath waiting for a hug, Inge Maria Jensen.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The old man walks by, leading the goat on a rope. She bleats at me. I think she is saying, &#x201c;Thank you for the delicious lunch,&#x201d; but I am too annoyed to say, &#x201c;You are welcome.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;But then the man scolds her and I think that maybe the goat is feeling sad and lonely too, and I give in.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Have a pleasant evening!&#x201d; I call after her, and wave.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Grandmother rolls her eyes and drags me up the road by the arm. She will not even hold my hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> The walk home is long and cold. By the time we reach Grandmother&#x2019;s farm, it is snowing, even though it is late in March and winter should be long gone. My legs are tired and my face is so raw that I don&#x2019;t even want to stop to build a snowman. My half-bald head stings with every new snow?ake that lands on it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Grandmother&#x2019;s house is pretty. It is bright red with black beams of wood holding the red bits together. Like strawberries and licorice. The roof is covered in a white icing of snow, but I can tell from the shape that it is made of straw thatching. This cheers me up a little. At least she doesn&#x2019;t live in a cave, or a hole in a tree. It happens, you know. I&#x2019;ve read about it in fairy tales.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Inside is warm and cozy, but it is an old woman&#x2019;s home. There is a rocking chair by the ?re, a basket of knitting, a small table with a lantern, and a Bible. There are no books full of stories and brightly colored pictures, no cat curled up by the ?re, no squishy chairs big enough for two people to sit, side by side, cuddling, reading, talking, telling each other about their day.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Well, child,&#x201d; Grandmother snaps. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t just stand there like a smoked herring with your eyes staring and your mouth open. Come inside and close the door before the wind chills the walls and there is enough snow indoors to ski.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I look up at her, thinking that she might just have made a joke. She is frowning like an ogre. I smile anyway, and point at a ?ake of snow that has blown in through the door and is ?itting its way toward Grandmother.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Before I know what has happened, my outstretched hand is smarting, burning, glowing red with ?nger shapes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Grandmother has slapped me!<br> &nbsp;<br> She stomps past me and slams the door shut.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You are behaving like a barbarian, child!&#x201d; she scolds.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Pointing, gaping, and disobeying your grandmother!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I stare at her, my bottom lip trembling.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&nbsp;I will not cry,</i> I say in my head. <i>I will not feel sorry for myself.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> But I do not know why she has slapped me. I just wanted to show her the beautiful snow?ake dancing across her ?oor.<br> &nbsp;<br> And I do not even know what a barbarian is.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I have never been hit before. Mama&#x2019;s hands were only ever used to hug, or to help with laces and buttons, or to stroke my cheek and hair.<br> &nbsp;<br> Grandmother whips o? my coat and scarf, wipes my face clean with a cold, damp cloth, and sits me down at the kitchen table with a bowl of steaming soup.<br> &nbsp;<br> I am starving. I have not eaten since the boat left Copenhagen yesterday. It&#x2019;s not easy to eat when you are watching ?sh guts slide around at your feet and have a sea-sick pig moaning at you. My stomach feels like it has shrunk to the size of a thimble and now it is begging for me to stretch it out with some food once again.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Grandmother says grace&#x2014;&#x201c;Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest. Let thy gifts to us be blest&#x201d;&#x2014;and nods for me to eat.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;The soup looks delicious&#x2014;?our balls and meatballs crowd the bowl of steaming broth, bobbing merrily between the chunks of onion and carrot.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;But I am even more excited by the beautiful spoon lying beside my hand. It is large and shiny and has a pattern of ?owers along its handle. It is certainly a girl spoon and perhaps even a talking spoon. There are such things. I know, because I have read about this too, in my fairy-tale book.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I lift the spoon and say, &#x201c;Thank you, pretty spoon, for your help in eating my food.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Grandmother rolls her eyes and eats her soup.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I smile at the spoon and begin to eat, getting faster with every mouthful. It tastes delicious and I feel my tummy stretch and my face defrost. It is not enough, but when I have ?nished I say, &#x201c;Thank you, Grandmother.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She looks pleased and places not one, but three slices of white bread before me. Then she puts a bowl of jam and a pat of butter on the table.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;My mouth is watering and my tummy is growling at me to get wol?ng, but I am afraid that this is some kind of trick. Perhaps Grandmother is testing me to see whether I am a greedy child as well as a barbarian.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I sit there, hands folded politely in my lap, more miserable than a goose on Christmas Eve. Grandmother is bustling around the kitchen, boiling the kettle, making tea. She is pretending to be preoccupied, but I know that she is watching out the corner of her eye.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;The butter is winking at me in the light of the candle, begging me to eat it, and the jam is glistening with the goodness of a million blackberries. At last, too hungry to hold back a moment longer, I plunge my knife into the butter and spread it thickly on my soft white bread. I shovel the spoon into the jam and splat an enormous blob onto the bread, then stu? the entire slice into my mouth at once, before Grandmother can stop me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;By the time she sits down at the table with a cup of tea for herself and a glass of milk for me, I have gobbled all three pieces of bread. The remaining butter looks like it has been attacked by a hungry troll, and the jam bowl is empty except for a few blackberry seeds clinging to the sides. My cheeks are bulging with the last piece of bread and jam, my tongue is dancing with sugar, and my tummy is cheering with happiness. Only my head is ?lled with dread.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I look up to face Grandmother and she is nodding in approval. I cannot believe it! Her black eyes are soft and melty, and underneath the wrinkles&#x2014;I gulp at the thought&#x2014;her face looks just like Mama&#x2019;s.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Good girl,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;I never could abide fussy eaters. A hearty appetite is a gift from God.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I am overwhelmed with relief. Desperate to please my grandmother, to make her love me, I smile and say, &#x201c;Thank you, Grandmother. That is the most beautiful berry jam I have ever tasted.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I pick up the jam spoon and hold it to my ear.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;And the little jam spoon says it is the most delicious jam that she has ever served. She is quite giddy with the sweetness and joy of it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It seems to do the trick, because even though Grandmother is rolling her eyes once more, her face still looks like Mama&#x2019;s and she doesn&#x2019;t slap me again this day.<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> I am lying awake listening to Grandmother&#x2019;s snoring. You&#x2019;d think it would be annoying, but I am glad for it. I have never had to share a bed before, but I&#x2019;m grateful that I have not been sent away into a dark corner of the house on my own. I could not bear to be all alone tonight. Not in this strange new house, so far from our apartment in Copenhagen. So far from Mama.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I think of the horrible misunderstanding with the dancing snow?ake that ended with a slap and harsh words. Then I recall how pleased Grandmother seemed when I thanked her for my soup. Perhaps I should learn to be thankful for the good things as they come along, no matter how small. That would show Grandmother that I am a decent girl. It might even make her love me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;Besides, I am learning that there are many dreadful things that can push their way into my life, so I&#x2019;d better enjoy the good things when I can.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;I snuggle up to Grandmother, wrapping my arm around her large, soft middle.

Low in saturated fats and easy to use, flavored oils make healthful alternatives to mayonnaises and sauces in everything from marinades and vinaigrettes to appetizers and entrees. Written by Michael Chiarello, renowned chef and creator of a popular line of infused oils, <i>Flavored Oils</i> presents a dazzling array of tempting recipes, from a heady Rosemary and Roasted Lemon Marinade to a delicate Beet Salad with Tarragon and Orange Oil to a savory Pork Tenderloin with Molasses, Bacon, and Porcini Vinaigrette. Brimming with inventive ideas and lavishly illustrated with full-color photographs, this unique volume makes a welcome companion for the home cook, as well as a lovely gift.</p><p>Michael Chiarello -- chef and owner of the acclaimed Tra Vigne restaurant in the Napa Valley -- is the creator of Consorzio, a popular line of flavored oils and vinegars.<br><br>Penelope Wisner is the co-author, with Michael Chiarello of Chronicle's Flavored Oils (over 40,000 copies sold).<br><br>Daniel Proctor is a San Francisco-based photographer whose previous book credits include The Il Fornaio Baking Book and Flavored Oils.The owner/chef of Napa Valley's Tra Vigne restaurant, Chiarello shares his wisdom about those darlings of today's ambitious cooks, flavored oils. No secret to anyone who's dined in an upscale restaurant within the last 10 years, oils flavored with herbs (or fruit, garlic or porcini) add complexity to many dishes. Chiarello's detailed advice on their judicious use includes instructions for infusions that are careful yet not fussy (e.g., be sure to rinse cloths thoroughly before using them as filters, lest the taste of a detergent be imparted). Noting that commercially prepared flavored oils are also available, he offers simple and clear recipes (the Garlic Smashed Potatoes are particularly tempting) in which plain olive oil can be substituted for the jazzier variations. The festive book design and close-up color photos match Chiarello's cheery tones.

It is longlisted for the Baileys Women&#39;s Prize for Fiction 2015. &#34;Winter bouquets should be offered to the clever and stylish Rachel Cusk: her novel Outline is smoothly accomplished, and fascinating both on the surface and in its depths.&#34; (Hilary Mantel, Guardian). A woman writer goes to Athens in the height of summer to teach a writing course. Though her own circumstances remain indistinct, she becomes the audience to a chain of narratives, as the people she meets tell her one after another the stories of their lives. Beginning with the neighbouring passenger on the flight out and his tales of fast boats and failed marriages, the storytellers talk of their loves and ambitions and pains, their anxieties, their perceptions and daily lives. In the stifling heat and noise of the city the sequence of voice begins to weave a complex human tapestry. The more they talk the more elliptical their listener becomes, as she shapes and directs their accounts until certain themes begin to emerge: the experience of loss, the nature of family life, the difficulty of intimacy and the mystery of creativity itself. Outline is a novel about writing and talking, about self-effacement and self-expression, about the desire to create and the human art of self-portraiture in which that desire finds its universal form. It was also shortlisted for the Goldsmiths Prize 2014. It is named one of the best fiction books of 2014 by The New Yorker, The Guardian, The Independent and Glamour.</p><p>Rachel Cusk was born in 1967 and is the author of seven novels: Saving Agnes, which won the Whitbread First Novel Award, The Temporary, The Country Life, which won a Somerset Maugham Award, The Lucky Ones, which was shortlisted for the Whitbread Novel Award, In the Fold and Arlington Park, which was shortlisted for the Orange Prize and The Bradshaw Variations.

Of the righteous. The final state of the righteous is described as eternal life (Mat. 25 : 46), glory (2 Cor. 4 : 17), rest (Heb. 4:9), knowledge (1 Cor. 18 : 8-10), holiness (Rev. 21:27), service (Rev. 22:3), worship (Rev. 19:1), society ( Heb. 12 : 23), communion with God (Rev. 21: 8).

From 1872 until 1912 Strong served as president and professor of theology at the Rochester Theological Seminary in Rochester, New York. Among Northern Baptists he earned profound respect and exercised wide influence. As the Northern Baptist Convention began to polarize into liberal and fundamentalist factions after 1910, Strong sought to unify them on a platform of traditional doctrinal affirmations and modern scholarship. He persuaded John D. Rockefeller to underwrite a great Baptist university, which resulted in the establishment of the University of Chicago. But <i>Systematic Theology</i> was Strong's most influential legacy.<p></p></p><h2>O&#39;Sullivan Stew</h2><p>When the witch of Crookhaven, a village on the zigzagging coast of Ireland, has her horse stolen by the King and strikes back with famine and disaster, Kate decides to save the day by getting the horse back for her.</p><p><b>Hudson Talbott</b>&nbsp;has written and illustrated more than 20 children&#x2019;s books, including&nbsp;Newbery Honor winner&nbsp;<i>Show Way&nbsp;</i>(by Jacqueline Woodson),&nbsp;ALA Notable Book and VOYA Honor Book&nbsp;<i>Leonardo&#x2019;s Horse&nbsp;</i>(by Jean Fritz), and&nbsp;<i>We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story</i>, which was adapted into an animated film by Steven Spielberg. He lives in the Hudson Valley of New York and in New York City.Grade 1-5-Feisty Kate O'Sullivan may daydream some of the time, but she knows when action is needed. When tax collectors visit her Irish village and steal the witch's red stallion, the girl tries to enlist the help of the townsfolk, who shrug their shoulders and declare that their neighbor isn't one of them. The witch goes "into a snit," all sorts of disasters occur, and food becomes scarce. Kate prods her father and brothers into action and they set off to steal the stallion back. Caught by the king and threatened with hanging, Kate saves each family member by telling a clever story. The horse is returned, and the O'Sullivans are set free, whereupon they go home to celebrate. When the king arrives at Kate's doorstep to declare his love, she says that she might marry him in five years, after she has some of her own adventures. Kate is a lively, take-charge heroine and Talbott's colorful illustrations capture her spirit perfectly, whether her hair is standing on end as she sneezes a mighty "AAAA CHOOO" or her eyes mirror innocent pleasure as she turns down the king's proposal. This is not a simple tale, but the pictures and text work so well together that the events move along with ease. Full of broad and subtle humor, the story will be a read-aloud favorite, but it also has much to offer children who like to pore over detailed illustrations and daydream about other worlds.<br><i>Barbara Scotto, Michael Driscoll School, Brookline, MA</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Black Postcards: A Rock &amp; Roll Romance</h2><p>A founder of two moderately successful rock bands describes his coming-of-age as a cultural outsider, his observations about the music industry, and his witness to the emergence of the indie and alternative music genres. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Dean Wareham was born in New Zealand in 1963. He has recorded sixteen albums, including <i>On Fire</i> (with Galaxie 500), <i>Penthouse</i> (with Luna) and most recently Back Numbers (as one half of Dean &amp; Britta).In his grumpy but informative memoir, Wareham, the lead guitarist and vocalist for seminal independent rock bands Galaxie 500 and Luna, recounts the highs and lows of his life as a musician. While Wareham's narrative voice is not particularly warm, he is refreshingly frank (though quite defensive) about the personal conflicts that broke up Galaxie 500, as well as about his later, somewhat more conventional rock and roll antics, which included drug use and infidelity. For most readers, the heart of the book will come in the first hundred odd pages, which focus on the financially difficult but artistically fruitful run of Galaxie 500, featuring Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang, in the late 1980s and early '90s. The stories of nights spent on the floors of college radio station managers and recording classic albums in three days are the stuff of do-it-yourself legend, and at its best, the book serves as a clear narrative of the travails of independent musicians in the days before mp3s and Pitchfork Media (which gets a snarky shout-out). Wareham gets a lot of mileage out of frustration with booking agents, band mates and radio stations, and over the course of the book, one gets a prevailing sense of how truly difficult it can be for some great musicians to break through the mass media wall. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She'd really rather they stay safely on the farm, even Sarah, who was nearing thirty and had long since been accepted as a maidal, an old maid, by their Pennsylvania Amish community.<br><br>What was there to be careful of on this peaceful back road that wound between Amish and Englisch farms on its way to the town of Laurel Ridge? The route took a bit longer to reach her quilt shop than if Sarah had gone by the main road, but was worth it to keep her mother from worrying.<br><br>"Mamm is being a little silly, ain't so, Molly?" She could talk to her buggy horse out here without fear of being overheard. "There's not even a storm cloud in the sky today."<br><br>Molly flickered her ears in response to Sarah's voice and then broke stride. The mare tossed her head, snorting.<br><br>"What are you&#x2014;"<br><br>Sarah stopped, seeing a few seconds later what Molly had sensed immediately. Smoke, snaking its way up between the trees ahead of her.<br><br>"Someone burning trash, that's all." But doubt threaded her words. There was too much smoke for that, surely. Hard on the thought she saw the sparks shooting upward, landing among the trees. Her heart thudded in her chest.<br><br><em>Fire.</em> The one thing that farmers feared most, especially in a dry summer like this one. She slapped the lines, sending the mare surging ahead. She'd have to see for herself what was burning.<br><br>Around the next curve in the winding road, the source was visible. Flames licked the back wall of a barn, and smoke billowed upward, fanned by the summer breeze. An unused barn, thank the gut Lord, part of the property belonging to an elderly widow who lived in town. No animals were in danger, at least, but if the fire spread&#x2014;<br><br>Sarah froze for an instant, undecided. Race to the nearest phone to call for help? Or check first in case someone needed help?<br><br>A glimpse of the small cottage near the barn decided her. The cottage wasn't empty&#x2014;Mrs. Everly let Gus Hill live there in exchange for keeping an eye on the property. Sarah had to be sure he wasn't in danger.<br><br>Turning an unwilling Molly onto the lane, Sarah touched her with the buggy whip, and they bucketed up to the cottage. Sarah jumped down from the buggy seat and raced to the door, her breath coming quickly. If Gus was there, surely he'd have smelled the fire by now. Unless he'd somehow provided himself with a bottle, in which case he could well be passed out and unaware of the danger.<br><br>"Gus! Gus Hill! Are you in there?" Sarah pounded on the door, glancing toward the flames that licked at the barn roof. "Gus!" She twisted the knob, and the door swung open.<br><br>A quick glance around the two littered rooms told her that wherever Gus was, he wasn't here. But the barn&#x2014;<br><br>She ran back outside. The fire ate greedily at one corner of the roof, sending a shower of sparks toward the trees. He surely wasn't in there. He couldn't be. She should hurry to the nearest phone. But she couldn't, not without being certain.<br><br>Her breath catching, Sarah raced to the barn. The heat radiating from it was terrifying, but she had to look&#x2014;had to be certain Gus wasn't in there. She grabbed the hem of her apron and held it over her mouth and nose. Eyes watering, she peered through the open doorway.<br><br>Empty&#x2014;not even any old hay bales to feed the fire. And no crumpled body lying unconscious, either.<br><br>A timber crashed, flaming, to the barn floor, sending a trail of fire heading toward her. Sarah spun, fleeing to the buggy, not needing to use the whip to persuade Molly into a gallop. They jolted back down the lane, back around the bend. The Stoltzfus farm, that would be closest, and they had a phone shanty near their barn.<br><br>Molly raced up the Stoltzfuses' lane, heading straight for their barn as if it were her own. Sarah halted the mare at the phone shanty, stumbled down and grabbed the receiver, hitting 911. By the time she'd gasped out the information to the emergency dispatcher, Ben Stoltzfus was running toward her from the barn, followed by three of his sons, while his wife, Miriam, hurried from the house, wiping her hands on a dish towel.<br><br>"Was ist letz, Sarah? What's wrong?" Ben grasped her arm.<br><br>A fit of coughing seized her, and she could only point.<br><br>"Ach, how did we not smell it? Fire&#x2014;the old Everly barn, ja?"<br><br>Sarah nodded, catching her breath. "I spotted it when I was passing. The sparks..." She didn't need to explain the danger to Ben. He was already turning to his sons.<br><br>"Buckets and shovels into the wagon, quick. We must keep the fire from spreading until the fire truck gets here."<br><br>Wide-eyed, the boys ran to obey. Ben raced for the paddock and his buggy horse.<br><br>Miriam had reached Sarah by then and wrapped her arm around her. "You're all right? Komm, let me see. You didn't burn yourself?"<br><br>"No, no, I'm fine." A cough interrupted the words. "Just need a drink of water, I think."<br><br>"For sure. Into the house, now." Miriam glanced to the oldest of her daughters. "Emma, go and call the neighbors. Tell them the Everly barn is burning. Quick!"<br><br>Ten-year-old Emma paled, but she bolted to the phone shanty.<br><br>Suddenly weak in the knees, Sarah was grateful for Miriam's arm around her as they headed for the farmhouse. Miriam, like any Amish mammi, clucked and comforted and scolded all at once as she gently shoved Sarah onto a kitchen chair and then set a glass of water in front of her.<br><br>"You rest a minute. I'll start coffee. Lucky I have a couple of jugs of lemonade I can take over, too. The firefighters will need a drink."<br><br>Sarah nodded, accepting Miriam's automatic assumption that they would provide what was needed. It was what neighbors did.<br><br>"Maybe take drinking water, as well. I don't know what the water source is over there."<br><br>"Ja, that's true." Miriam bustled around, putting one daughter in charge of the baby and enlisting the other two in carrying jugs and cups to Sarah's buggy.<br><br>"I looked for Gus Hill." Sarah cleared her throat and took another gulp of water. "No sign of him."<br><br>"He's never one to hang around if there's trouble," Miriam said darkly. "I don't know what Julia Everly pays him for looking after the place for her, but he's not worth it, that's certain sure."<br><br>Reluctant as she was to speak ill of anyone, Sarah had to admit that Miriam was most likely right. Gus was a fixture in the township, well known for his talent for getting by on the least possible effort.<br><br>By the time the buggy was loaded, Ben and the boys had already taken off in the wagon. The wail of a siren pierced the air. The fire truck roared by, followed by the usual cars and trucks carrying extra volunteers. Most of the able-bodied men in the area belonged to the volunteer fire company, both Amish and Englisch. Like Aaron King.<br><br>Sarah shoved the name to the back of her mind as she and Miriam drove Sarah's buggy in the wake of the volunteers. She had no right to be more concerned for Aaron than for any other of her Amish brethren. Now if she could only convince herself of that fact...<br><br>By the time they reached the Everly property, the barn was fully engulfed. Figures in yellow protective gear swarmed around it, but Sarah could see they were more intent on keeping the fire from spreading than on trying to save the structure. It was too late for that.<br><br>Molly whinnied, shaking her head nervously, so Sarah led her a short distance away and tethered her to a tree. Miriam had shoved a folding table into the buggy, behind the seat. They pulled it out and began setting thermoses and jugs on it.<br><br>Scanning the firefighters, all so alike in their gear, Sarah couldn't deny she was searching for Aaron. She caught a glimpse of a chestnut-colored beard, and her breath went out in an involuntary sigh of relief. He was there, of course, and he was safe. That slighter figure next to him was probably his teenage brother, Jonah. Aaron would be keeping a close eye on the boy.<br><br>The barn roof collapsed with a roar and a shower of embers, and for a few minutes the scene reminded Sarah of an angry beehive as the volunteers fought to extinguish the flying sparks.<br><br>Miriam caught her hand, and Sarah realized the woman was watching her husband. Ben leaned on his shovel, coughing, but a moment later he'd straightened and was back at work.<br><br>Finally the barn was nothing more than a sullen black heap, still sending smoke and fumes into the air. In twos and threes the firefighters began drifting over to the table, and Sarah and Miriam were suddenly busy pouring out drinks.<br><br>"Sarah?" The sound of her name had her turning.<br><br>Mac Whiting, Laurel Ridge's police chief, stood behind her, pulling a notebook from his pocket. He looked very official in his blue uniform with a weapon at his hip, and only the fact that she'd known him since childhood kept her from retreating into the usual Amish reticence when confronted with Englisch officials. "Some coffee, Mac?"<br><br>He shook his head. "Save it for the guys who did all the work." He snapped his pen. "I understand you called in the fire."<br><br>"I was on my way to town. To the shop," she added, although Mac would know that well enough. "I saw the smoke before I came around the bend, and then I saw the flames. In the back, the fire was, then," she said, pointing.<br><br>"So you went over to Ben and Miriam's to call?" He jotted the information down, though what good it would do anyone, she didn't know.<br><br>"Ja. But I checked first to see if Gus was here. I pounded on the cottage door. No answer, but I was afraid he was asleep, maybe."<br><br>Mac grinned. "That's a diplomatic way of putting it. I take it you didn't see him."<br><br>"The door wasn't locked, so I checked inside, but the cottage was empty. Then I feared he might be in the barn." Sarah seemed to feel the heat on her face again.<br><br>"I looked, but no&#x2014;"<br><br>"You never go near a burning building!" Aaron King was suddenly at her side, looking as if he'd like to shake her. "Ach, Sarah, whatever were you thinking?"<br><br>His obvious concern warmed Sarah's heart despite the fact that he was looking at her as if she were an erring child.<br><br>"I was thinking same as you would have," she said, her voice tart. "If someone was lying there in danger, I couldn't just go away. And don't go telling me I shouldn't have, because I had to."<br><br>Aaron's hand closed around her wrist for an instant, and her breath caught. Then he let go, shaking his head, his brown eyes crinkling a bit at the corners. "You always were a stubborn one, Sarah Bitler. Quiet, but stubborn."<br><br><em>Too quiet,</em> she couldn't help thinking. If she'd given him even a hint of what she felt, all those years ago, would it have made a difference?<br><br>"It's just as well she looked, or we'd have thought there was a body in there." Mac sounded practical. "We might have known Gus wouldn't be anywhere around when there was trouble."<br><br>That seemed to be the unanimous opinion of Gus.<br><br>"Julia Everly is going to be so upset." Sarah pictured the tart-tongued elderly woman. "She never would let go of this property, because her husband used to love coming out here. And now that she's laid herself up with a broken leg, she'll really be fretting."<br><br>"You mean she'll be calling me every five minutes to find out what progress I'm making," Mac said.<br><br>Sarah looked at him blankly. "Calling you? Why?"<br><br>"I'm the local fire marshal, remember? I'm supposed to have answers."<br><br>"Ja, but what could you do?" she asked. "The firefighters did their best. At least they kept the blaze from spreading. As dry as it's been, it's lucky the woods didn't catch."<br><br>"It's not about that." Mac frowned. "Look around you, Sarah. There's not a cloud in the sky. No lightning to set it off. Nothing combustible stored in the barn. No electricity, even. So how did the barn catch fire to begin with?"<br><br><em>Arson.</em> She felt Aaron stiffen next to her. The word didn't have to be said aloud to chill the blood.<br><br>Sarah finally made it to town by early afternoon. Instead of heading straight for the quilt shop, she drove the buggy down a quiet residential street. Her business partner, Allison Standish, would have things in hand at the shop, and Sarah felt compelled to visit Julia Everly. The elderly woman would certain sure be upset by the fire.<br><br>After tying the mare to a convenient porch railing at the modern ranch-style house, Sarah walked to the front door, mentally rehearsing soothing words. Julia was normally the feistiest of eightysomething women, but being confined to a chair by a heavy cast on her leg had taken some of the starch out of her. Sarah had stopped by the previous week, bringing an apple crumb pie her mamm had made, and had found Julia surprisingly subdued.<br><br>The door opened almost before Sarah had touched the doorbell. "Oh. It's you, Sarah." Donna Edwards, a distant cousin of Julia's who made sporadic efforts to look after her, gave the impression that a welcoming smile was too much effort. "I was just trying to get my cousin to take a little nap in her chair. I don't think company is a good idea right now."<br><br>"I don't want to disturb her, but I thought she'd want to see me." If anything, Sarah would think Julia needed more company, not less.<br><br>Donna looked at her blankly, her thin face registering nothing other than a rather peevish attitude, apparently toward being interrupted. She reminded Sarah irresistibly of one of her mother's irascible hens.<br><br>"I was the one who discovered the fire," Sarah explained patiently. "I understood someone notified her, but&#x2014;"<br><br>"Yes, of course." Donna's expression relaxed, and she fingered the glass beads that dangled over one of the frilly blouses she always wore. "You must think I'm half-asleep. Chief Whiting came by to let Julia know a while ago. I just didn't realize you were the one who'd found the fire."<br><br>Sarah nodded. "I spotted it on my way in to work this morning." She had a feeling she'd get tired of saying those words.<br><br></p><h2>Conflict and Community in Corinth</h2><p>This unprecedented commentary applies an exegetical method informed by both sociological insight and rhetorical analysis to the study of 1 and 2 Corinthians.

Make Room! (1966), the basis for the film Soylent Green.Even after four previous capers on the various planets of Harrison's high-tech (but recognizably hip) 25th century, the freshness of the author's language overcomes a somewhat predictable plot structure to make this outing by his favorite future antihero, Slippery Jim DiGriz, thoroughly entertaining. This installment (following The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You! ) finds the con man/hero under sentence of death by slow-acting poison after he has (almost) robbed an impenetrable Mint. To acquire the antidote he must contract with his natural foe, the military types of the Galactic League. Thus he agrees to retrieve an alien artifact from a prison planet occupied by assorted religious maniacs, TV junkies and Survivalist recluses. What better time, then, to start a rock 'n' roll band? Combing military service files for signs of both combat capacity and musical ability (DiGriz finds they are virtually incompatible) he assembles the Stainless Steel Rats band and proceeds to get himself and his three unlikely commando sidekicks (Steengo, Floyd and Madonette) arrested, sentenced and deported to the prison planet. Once there, the prefab four demonstrate their good humor and hand-to- hand combat abilities encountering the nouveau Vikings, fundamentalist Shepherds, troglodytes and even Feminist Separatists as they race the clock in search of the mysterious artifact. The breakneck pace and DiGriz's offbeat interior monologue keep the plot airborne, and both SF hardcore and mainstream readers should find this an enjoyable adventure. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mastering Witchcraft: A Practical Guide for Witches, Warlocks &amp; Covens</h2><p>A guide that reveals the rites, signs, omens and step-by-step secrets of the art of witchcraft.

Whitton found that if he used hypnosis to regress patients to past lives and especially to the Bardo, in which the soul is said to choose the circumstances of its next life to work out certain personal problems, outstanding results occurred. When patients realize that they have chosen their present circumstances, their symptoms abate or disappear, replaced by a healthier attitude. This may be a new game people are playing, but as a therapeutic technique, it works for Whitton. Apparently no one else has yet tried to repeat his results.

Draws parallels between nonviolent and military strategy. Documents twenty-three cases showing how nonviolent action has been applied to conflicts throughout the world in the twentieth century&#34;--Provided by publisher.</p><p>Today's world is in desperate need of realistic alternatives to violent conflict. Nonviolent action&#x2014;properly planned and executed&#x2014;is a powerful and effective force for political and social change. Recently, advocates have applied nonviolent methods and strategies with great success in Serbia and Ukraine. Waging Nonviolent Struggle builds on 50 years of Dr. Sharp&#x2019;s definitive academic research and practical experience aiding nonviolent struggles around the world. It breaks new ground about how to strategically plan nonviolent action and make it more effective. Dr. Sharp and his team of scholars document lessons learned firsthand, from Tiananmen Square to the Latvian Supreme Council, and from witnesses to the freedom riders in Alabama and the anti-Nazi resistance in Norway. Building on the power analysis of his seminal Politics of Nonviolent Action, Dr. Sharp coherently integrates his theories into praxis, with a vitality tested on the frontlines, often under extreme violence. Any serious student&#x2014;or practitioner&#x2014;of nonviolent struggle will find this book an invaluable resource. Skeptics will be compelled to seriously consider nonviolent action as a tried, tested and proven alternative to both passivity and violence.ABOUT THE AUTHOR <p>Gene Sharp is Senior Scholar at the Albert Einstein Institution in Boston, Massachusetts.

Growing up in the Northern Rockies in a "land of boots and saddles, guns and fishing rods, and the smell of pines and grass," he observed the ways of animals wild and tame, braved rugged mountaintops and freezing rivers. He forged friendships with the local Indians and with the "remittance men," second sons of British aristocracy who left their stamp on the new country with ready cash and a zest for high living. Here are thrilling and humorous tales of breaking horses, hunting bears, and living proud and free, told in a naturally eloquent voice.

He is a noted naturalist and wildlife photographer, and his work has appeared in Natural History as well as several outdoor magazines. His book Grizzly Country is considered a modern classic on the big bears.</p><h2>Tell Me a Story: Narrative and Intelligence (Rethinking Theory)</h2><p>How are our memories, our narratives, and our intelligence interrelated? What can artificial intelligence and narratology say to each other? In this pathbreaking study by an expert on learning and computers, Roger C.

What can artificial intelligence and narratology say to each other? In this pathbreaking study by an expert on learning and computers, Roger C. Schank argues that artificial intelligence must be based on real human intelligence, which consists largely of applying old situations - and our narratives of them - to new situations in less than obvious ways. To design smart machines, Schank therefore investigated how people use narratives and stories, the nature and function of those narratives, and the connection of intelligence to both telling and listening. As Schank explains, &#34;We need to tell someone else a story that describes our experiences because the process of creating the story also creates the memory structure that will contain the gist of the story for the rest of our lives.

He began carrying a notebook in which he kept some of the details related to the different stories. The joy he found in retelling those myths continued when he discovered other stories. <br><br>According to Gerald Morris, &#x201c;I never lost my love of retelling the old stories. When I found Arthurian literature, years later, I knew at once that I wanted to retell those grand tales. So I pulled out my notebook . . . I retell the tales, peopling them with characters that I at least find easier to recognize, and let the magic of the Arthurian tradition go where it will.&#x201d; <br><br>Gerald Morris lives in Wausau, Wisconsin, with his wife and their three children. In addition to writing he serves as a minister in a church.<br><p>Gr 5-8-As he did in The Squire's Tale (Houghton, 1998), the author retells a knight's legend from the perspective of his helper and companion. In this entertaining and substantive story, Piers's wanderlust takes him to the court of King Arthur where he meets up with a lost soul, Parsifal, who longs to be a knight. Piers's mother has regaled him with stories of her life as a maid-in-waiting at the French court, so he has grown up with lofty ideas and the ambition to become a knight's page. Parsifal is clearly in need of his expertise. Readers familiar with the legend will recognize the main events. After Parsifal fails to ask "the" question and realizes his mistake, he continues his Grail quest alone, and Piers joins Sir Gawain and his page on further adventures, thus continuing the story begun in The Squire's Tale. Piers's overly earnest attempts to do the right thing and Gawain's wit provide most of the humor in the story, but the author avoids cheapening the significance of the Grail quest. Readers unfamiliar with Parsifal and Gawain's stories may wish for a "who's who" to keep up with the characters, but the sheer fun of this novel will keep them going. Unfortunately, the cover art looks like a video game and doesn't fit the story. Once past it, Arthurian fans will be hooked by the great writing. Katherine Paterson's Parzival (Dutton, 1998) is a more traditional retelling that would appeal to similar readers.-Cheri Estes, Detroit Country Day School Middle School, Beverly Hills, MI</p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Harbingers: A Repairman Jack Novel</h2><p>It starts off so simply: Jack, still feeling down after the tragic events of <i>Infernal</i>, is hanging in Julio's when a regular named Timmy asks him for help. His teenage niece has been missing since this morning; the police say it's too early to worry, but Timmy knows something bad has happened. Jack says he'll put the word out on the street. This innocent request triggers a chain of seemingly coincidental events that lead Jack into the darkest days of his life.<br>As has become evident in the series, Jack has been singled out, unwillingly, as the champion of one of the two supernatural forces contending for control of all human life on Earth. Neither of these forces are good or evil, just dangerous and amoral. They value and notice individual humans about as much as we do mosquitos. <br>Jack is desperate . . . and the last thing you want to do is make Jack desperate. That's when things begin to blow up and people begin to die.<br>A hang-onto-your-hat-and-heart thriller of triumph and tragedy that barrels along at F. Paul Wilson's trademark breakneck pace.<br></p><p>F. PAUL WILSON, the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of nine previous Repairman Jack novels, lives in Wall, New Jersey.<br>Chapter One&nbsp;<br>"Hey, Jack, can I bother you a minute?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Jack sat at his table in the rear of Julio's. He looked up from his coffee and saw Timmy O'Brien, one of Julio's regulars. A fiftyish guy, thin, hangdog face, watery eyes, and wearing a Hawaiian shirt in January.<br>&nbsp;<br>Julio's, an Upper West Side bar that had fought the good fight and succeeded in holding on to its working-class roots through the neighborhood's decades of legitimization, rehabilitation, restoration, and gentrification, had been Jack's hang for years. Julio always saved him a table where he could sit with his back to the wall.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Bother?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Well, yeah. I mean, I know about what happened last month, and I'm really sorry for your loss. I know you've still got to be bummed, but I could really use some help, Jack."<br>&nbsp;<br>"What kind?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Your kind."<br>&nbsp;<br>Jack sighed. He'd been on sabbatical, ignoring e-mails and voice mails from prospective customers. Didn't feel he could focus enough--or care enough--to earn his fee. That was part of it. Truth was he was having trouble caring about much of anything outside his small, immediate circle. No interest, no energy, and probably drinking too much these past three weeks.<br>&nbsp;<br>He didn't need a shrink to tell him he was depressed. But a shrink would want to give him pills, and Jack didn't want pills. He preferred beer--but not before lunch.<br>&nbsp;<br>He couldn't find the energy to get up and get out and get moving again. What was the point? Who cared? And when he got right down to it, did anything he did, anything he'd ever done, matter in the long run? Had he ever made a difference?<br>&nbsp;<br>He wondered.<br>&nbsp;<br>But Timmy looked so needy. Jack wasn't ready to venture outside his self-circumscribed world of Julio's, Abe's, Gia's, and his own place, but maybe he could make a few suggestions.<br>&nbsp;<br>He pointed to the seat across from him.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Shoot."<br>&nbsp;<br>As Timmy settled his butt in the chair and his draft on the table, Jack reviewed what he knew about the man.<br>&nbsp;<br>A dozen years ago Timmy had been an advertising hotshot, near the peak of the copywriter heap. Lots of money, but too much of it going up his nose. His agency had been on the short list for a big Citibank account and he had this idea that he was sure would clinch it for them. He'd once shown the Julio's gang a mockup of the ad.<br>&nbsp;<br>A big, neon-bright lettered cross with tiny letters below it:<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Jesus<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; a<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; v<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; e<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; s<br>&nbsp;<br>at CITIBANK<br>&nbsp;<br>Everyone here at Julio's had thought it was way cool, but the new Timmy said he had no idea where his old self had come up with such a stupid idea. The agency brass had told him to forget it, but coke-fueled grandiosity mixed with his own hubris had convinced him that this was the only way to go. So against all advice and all orders, he'd pitched it to the bank officers, telling them that though he knew it would be controversial, that very controversy would make Citibank a household name.<br>&nbsp;<br>The officers agreed, but figured the bank's name would be associated with other words in those households--like "hell-bound" and "damned" and "sacrilegious."<br>&nbsp;<br>The multimillion-dollar account went elsewhere. And soon after, so did Timmy.<br>&nbsp;<br>After bottoming out a few years later, he put himself in rehab, joined NA, and cleaned up his act.<br>&nbsp;<br>But the clean and sober Timmy was not the same man. The guy who'd had his finger on the pulse of America's wants--who'd even created some of those wants--could never quite localize that throb again. He was still in advertising, but working far below the apogee of his heyday. Always a little out of step--like the Hawaiian shirt--ever functioning just outside the norm. No longer big-time, resigned to be forever small-time.<br>&nbsp;<br>In other words, a prototypical Julio's regular.<br>&nbsp;<br>But Jack didn't remember ever seeing him here before five o'clock. And a morning beer--even if it was late morning--wasn't like the new Timmy. Something had to be bothering him.<br>&nbsp;<br>"It's about my niece."<br>&nbsp;<br>"How old?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Fourteen."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh, man."<br>&nbsp;<br>A problem with a fourteen-year-old girl. That could mean anything from promiscuity to drugs to being an all-around wild child. None of which Jack could help with.<br>&nbsp;<br>Timmy held up a hand. "Now, now, I know what you're thinking, but it's nothing like that. Cailin's a good kid. She goes to Mount Saint Ursula, scholarship and all--straight-A student, field hockey, the whole thing."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Then what is it?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"She's gone."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Ran off?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"I told you, Cailin's not like that. But this morning, somewhere between her house and school, she disappeared."<br>&nbsp;<br>"This morning?" Jack shook his head. "Hell, Timmy, she's been gone, what, four hours? She's probably off with her boyfriend."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Except her boyfriend's in school."<br>&nbsp;<br>"What do the police say?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Same as you: Hasn't been gone long enough. If someone had seen foul play, that'd be a different story. But with kids running away all the time, they're pretty blas� about the whole thing. Like, 'Yeah-yeah, come back when it's been a coupla days.' So I'm coming to you, Jack."<br>&nbsp;<br>Jack sighed. He could see Timmy was worried, but he had to lay out a few facts of life.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I don't do missing persons, Timmy, especially a hot case. And there's a very good reason for that: I can't. I don't have the resources. I'm just one guy, and the cops are many. And they've got all those computers and databases and people from CSI: New York."<br>&nbsp;<br>"But they're not using them!"<br>&nbsp;<br>"The other thing is, I'm not a detective. I'm a fix-it guy."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Well, then, fix this."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Timmy--"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Damn it, Jack!"<br>&nbsp;<br>Timmy slammed his palms on the table. His beer mug and Jack's coffee cup jumped. The midday regulars looked over, then went back to their drinks and talk. He lowered his voice.<br>&nbsp;<br>"My sister's going nuts, Jack, and so am I. I never had kids--two wives but no kids. Cailin's been like a daughter. I couldn't love her more if she were really mine."<br>&nbsp;<br>That struck a nerve. Jack knew the feeling. He had the same relationship with Vicky.<br>&nbsp;<br>"What do you think I can do, Timmy?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"You know people, and you know people who know people--people the cops don't know."<br>&nbsp;<br>"As in, 'I've Got Friends in Low Places'?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"You know what I mean. Put the word out--a sort of street-level Amber Alert. I'll pay a reward--five hundred, a thousand, my apartment, anything." His throat worked as his voice choked. "I just want her safe and sound. Is that too much to ask?"<br>&nbsp;<br>It might be, but Jack supposed he could make a few calls. Timmy was a regular here, and Julio's regulars tended to watch each others' backs. How could he say no?<br>&nbsp;<br>"Okay, I'll call some people." He kept his phone list at home. A quick walk from here. "But five hundred won't be enough."<br>&nbsp;<br>Timmy spread his hands. "I know you don't come cheap, but like I said: anything."<br>&nbsp;<br>"What I'm trying to tell you is we're venturing into What's-in-it-for-me Land. Some of the guys I call, and most of the guys they call, aren't going to pass the word around out of the goodness of their hearts. They're going to need incentive."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Name the figure."<br>&nbsp;<br>Jack had done this before and knew it had to be set up so, in case of success, everyone along the chain walked away with something. What he'd tell his first-line contacts was that if someone in their contact string found the girl, they'd get the same reward as the finder. This would go down the line: If A tells B who tells C who tells D who finds the girl, all four get the same reward. Five hundred bucks apiece seemed like a good incentive--one that looked better and better as it moved down the chain, ballooning to a bonanza by the time it reached the street people.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Probably cost you twenty-five hundred, although it might go as high as five."<br>&nbsp;<br>Timmy slumped with relief.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Done. I can't think of anything better to spend it on."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Got a pen?" When Timmy handed him one, Jack grabbed a napkin and readied to write. "What's she look like? What was she wearing?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"She left the house in a blue coat over a typical Catholic girls' school outfit. You know: white blouse, blue sweater, blue-and-white plaid skirt, blue knee socks."<br>&nbsp;<br>Jack shook his head. "Got to be a gazillion kids dressed like that in the city."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yeah, but they don't have Cailin's hair. It's bright red--all natural--and wild. She's always complaining about how nothing she tries will control it."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Got a picture?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Sure." Timmy fumbled in a back pocket for his wallet. "You thinking of posting it around?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Jack shook his head. He had neither the time nor the manpower for that sort of canvassing.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Just want to see her face."<br>&nbsp;<br>Timmy wiggled a wrinkled photo out of his wallet and passed it across.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Taken maybe a month ago."<br>&nbsp;<br>Jack stared at the girl in the picture. Cute kid. Round face, freckles, red and green bands on her braces, and a Santa cap squished on her wild red mop.<br>&nbsp;<br>"You weren't kidding about the hair."<br>&nbsp;<br>"She goes on and on about it. She'll wear you out with her constant carping about it, but . . ." He wiped an eye. "I'd give anything to be listening to her right now."<br>&nbsp;<br>Jack rose and clapped him on the shoulder.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'll get on it. Can I keep the photo?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Sure. Long as you need it."<br>&nbsp;<br>"No promises, Timmy, beyond making the calls. It's a long shot."<br>&nbsp;<br>Timmy grabbed his hand and squeezed.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I know, but you're all I've got right now."<br>&nbsp;<br>Jack waved good-bye to Julio and stepped out into the cutting January wind.<br>&nbsp;<br>Long shot? Who was he kidding? More like hitting a dime at a thousand yards with a Saturday night special.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2006 by F.

Here for the first time is the full account of that violent, deadly stand by Special Forces team A-101 at the tiny compound of Lang Vei. Nineteen Silver Stars, a Distinguished Service Cross, and a Medal of Honor were awarded, yet until now the battle has languished in the war's shadows. Making use of extensive interviews with survivors, recently uncovered oral histories, and official records, author William Phillips presents astounding tales of individual and team courage against overwhelming odds. He vividly recounts the story of eight Green Berets who held out all night against tank, grenade, and flamethrower attacks. He details the embattled camp's controversial and much-delayed relief and extraction--not by the U.S. Marines from Khe Sanh nine miles away but by super-secret MACV-SOG commandos and an air campaign of unprecedented proportions.</p><br><p>Phillips focuses on four Green Berets, including his first cousin, missing in action since the battle, to deliver a poignant, unforgettable portrait of some of America's finest soldiers leading their cherished Bru and Hre montagnard charges in the battle of their lives. A Vietnam combat veteran himself, Phillips weighs and analyzes the conflicting stories of snarled communications, faulty weapons, countermanded orders, and service rivalries to flush out the truth of Lang Vei. His balanced, highly readable account serves as a testament to those special warriors of whom so much was asked during the Vietnam War.</p></p><p>They Knew They Were Alone. <br>They Knew The Enemy Was Coming.<br>But They Didn't Know What It Would Take To Survive...<br><br>In Vietnam, 1968, the enemy was planning the kind of overwhelming attack that broke the French at Dien Bien Phu. But while U.S. Marines dug in at Khe Sanh, and recon missions probed the Laotian border, the enemy proved elusive-until it struck full force on an isolated Green Beret outpost. In the early darkness of February 7th, two dozen U.S. Special Forces soldiers and their indigenous fighters were overrun, attacked by waves of ground troops, mortars, flame-throwers, and a weapon they had not prepared for: North Vietnamese tanks. The battle of Lang Vei had begun.<br><br>In this gripping, keenly told account, author William R. Phillips chronicles a desperate struggle for survival as the Green Berets held out against unrelenting fire from point blank range. Then, as the badly wounded Americans fought their way out of one death trap, they found themselves in another, still besieged with little hope for rescue-until a super secret, quick-reaction strike force launched one of the most daring missions of the war...<br><br>"The story of the Battle of Lang Vei is presented here in detail, with unswerving dedication to objectivity and accuracy by its author...I am pleased to recommend [this] book." -William C.

Over two hundred years before, Katherine Howard had attended his wedding to her cousin Mary. He hadn't gone to hers--her marriage to his father had occurred four years after his supposed death. Made a queen in July, 1540, she'd been beheaded in February, 1542, nineteen months later.</p><p>She'd been young and foolish and very likely guilty of the adultery she'd been charged with, but she hadn't deserved to have her spirit trapped, replaying over and over the soul-destroying moment when she'd realized she was going to die.</p><p>"Henry?''</p><p>"Whatever he wants,'' Henry said without turning, "I doubt that I'll be able to give it to him.

"Henry, you're freaking me out.''</p><p>"Am I? Sorry.'' Shaking off his melancholy, the ex-prince turned and managed a wry smile. "You seem somewhat nonchalant about being haunted.''</p><p>Glad to have him back, Tony shrugged, a trace of the street kid he'd been lingering in the jerky movement. "He's haunting you, not me. And besides, between living with you for the last two years and dealing with the weirdos at the store, I've learned to take the unexpected in stride.''</p><p>"Have you?'' Not at all pleased with being compared to the weirdos at the video store where Tony worked, Henry's smile broadened, showing teeth. When he heard the younger man's heartbeat quicken, he crossed the room and wrapped an ivory hand around a slender shoulder. "So I've lost the ability to surprise you?''</p><p>"I didn't say that.'' Tony's breathing grew ragged as a cool thumb traced the line of his jaw.</p><p>"Perhaps not exactly that.''</p><p>"Uh, Henry...''</p><p>"What?''</p><p>He shook his head. It was enough to know Henry would stop if he wanted him to. More than enough, considering he didn't want him to. "Never mind. Not important.''</p><p>A short while later, teeth met through a fold of skin, the sharp points pierced a vein and, for a time, the dead were washed away with the blood of the living.</p><p>The warm evening air lapping against her face, Corporal Phyllis Roberts cruised along Commissioner Street humming the latest Celine Dion hit and tapping her fingers against the top of the steering wheel. Although the new Ports Canada Police cars had air-conditioning, she never used it as she disliked the enclosed, spaceship feeling of driving with the windows rolled up.</p><p>Three hours into her shift, she was in a good mood. So far, nothing had gone wrong.</p><p>Three hours and fifteen minutes into her shift, Corporal Roberts stopped humming.</p><p>Turning into Vanterm, as of this moment her least favorite of the harbor's twenty-seven cargo and cruise ship terminals, Corporal Roberts squinted to make out the tiny figures of three men dwarfed by the bulk of a Singapore-registered container ship. The pole lights that turned the long wooden pier into a patchwork of stacked containers and hard-edged shadows washed away features so thoroughly she was almost on top of them before she recognized one of the men.</p><p>Leaving her cap in the car, she picked up her long, rubber-handled flashlight, touched her nightstick, more out of habit than any thought she might have to use it, and walked toward them. "You night-loading, Ted?''</p><p>Ted Polich, the shortest of the three longshoremen, jerked a balding head upward at the gantry crane that loomed over the dock like a mechanical bird of prey. "Controls have stiffened up and the son of a bitch is jerking left. We're trying to get it fixed tonight, so it doesn't slow loading tomorrow.''</p><p>"God forbid,'' the corporal muttered. A huge increase in Pacific Rim trade had the port scrambling to keep up. "Where is it?''</p><p>"Up by the bow. It's caught in one of them eddies between the dock and the ship.'' </p><p>Falling into step beside her, Polich shoved his hands in the pockets of grimy overalls. "We figured they'd send the city police.''</p><p>"Sorry. You're stuck with me until we know for sure you saw what you said you did.''</p><p>"You think we made it up?'' asked one of the other men indignantly, leaning around his companion to glare at the cop.</p><p>Corporal Roberts shook her head and sighed. "I couldn't possibly be that lucky.''</p><p>She wasn't.</p><p>Bobbing up and down in the narrow triangle between the bow and the dock was the body of a naked man, his back a pale, flesh-colored island, the strands of his hair sweeping against it like dark seaweed.</p><p>"Shit.''</p><p>Polich nodded. "That's what I said. You figure he's a jumper?''</p><p>"I doubt it.'' While they did occasionally get jumpers off the Lions Gate Bridge, they hadn't had one yet who'd stopped to take his clothes off. Pointing her flashlight beam at the water, she slowly swept the circle of illumination over the corpse. Bruises, large and small, made a mottled pattern of purple against the pale skin. Not very old--<i>and not going to get any olde</i>r, she told herself grimly--he hadn't been in the water for long.</p><p>"Funny what makes some of 'em float and some of 'em sink,'' Polich mused quietly beside her. "This guy's skin and bones, should'a gone right to the... God damn it! Would you look at that!''</p><p>The other two longshoremen crowded in to see.</p><p>Flung forward, Corporal Roberts tottered on the edge of the pier, saved at the last minute from a potentially dangerous swim by a muscular arm thrust in front of her like a filthy, cloth-covered, safety rail. Breathing heavily, she thanked Polich and snarled a warning at the other two.</p><p>As they backed up, too intent on the body in the water to be properly penitent, one of them muttered, "What the hell could've happened to his hands?''</p><p>Sunset the next night occurred behind cloud cover so heavy only the fading light gave evidence that the sun had set at all. At 7:23, Tony turned off his watch alarm and muted the inane conversation filling in a rain delay for a Seattle Mariners' home game. Who wanted to hear about a shortage of organ donors when they were waiting to watch baseball? He never <i>dreamed</i> he'd miss Fergie Oliver. Leaning back in his chair, he glanced down the hall, listening for the first sounds of Henry's return and straining to hear the rattle of ghostly chains.</p><p>As the sun released its hold and his senses slowly began to function, Henry sifted through and ignored a hundred familiar sensations. An impossible breeze stroked icy fingers across his cheek. He willed his arm to move and switched on the lamp.</p><p>The ghost stood where it had the day before--a nondescript young man, needing a haircut and shave, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. Its edges were indistinct and although Henry could see writing on the shirt, he couldn't make it out--whether because the writing hadn't fully materialized or because the items on the dresser behind the ghost's semitranslucent torso distracted him, he wasn't sure. As far as Henry could remember, he'd never seen the young man alive.</p><p>He half expected the specter to vanish when he sat up, but it remained at the foot of his bed. <i>It's waiting for something</i>. If a noncorporeal being could be said to have posture, the ghost's stance screamed anticipation.</p><p>"All right.'' He sighed and leaned back against the headboard. "What do you want?''</p><p>Slowly, the ghost lifted its arms and vanished.</p><p>Henry stared a moment longer at the place where it had been and wondered what could have possibly happened to its hands.</p><p>"It had no hands at all?'' When Henry nodded, Tony chewed his lower lip in thought. "Were they, like, cut off or ripped off or chewed off or what?'' he asked after a moment.</p><p>"They just weren't there.'' Henry took a bottle of water out of the fridge, opened it, and drained it. The growing popularity of bottled water had been a godsend; while blood provided total nourishment, all living things required water, and the purifying chemicals added by most cities made him ill. Bacteria, his system ignored. Chlorine, it rebelled against. Tossing the empty plastic bottle in the recycling bin, he leaned on the counter and stared down at his own hands. "They just weren't there,'' he repeated.</p><p>"Then I bet that's what he wants--vengeance. They always want vengeance.''</p><p>Raising an eyebrow at Tony's certainty, Henry asked just where he'd acquired his knowledge of what ghosts always wanted.</p><p>"You know, movies and stuff. He wants you to help him take revenge against the guy who took his hands.''</p><p>"And how am I supposed to do that?''</p><p>"Jeez, Henry, I don't know. You worked with Vicki; didn't she teach you nothing?''</p><p>"Anything.''</p><p>Tony rolled his eyes. "Okay, anything.''</p><p>Vicki Nelson, private investigator, ex-police detective, ex-lover&#x2014;Henry had worked with her for one short year before fate had brought them as close together as was possible with his kind and then had driven them apart. She'd returned to Toronto and her mortal lover. He'd made a new life for himself on the West Coast.</p><p>Had she taught him anything?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Did any of it have anything to do with handless ghosts?</p><p>No.</p><p>When he repeated his thoughts aloud for Tony's benefit, he added, "One thing she did teach me is that I'm not a detective. I'm a writer, and, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go write.'' Not entirely certain why memories of Vicki Nelson always made him so defensive, he headed for his computer, waving at the television on his way through the living room. "Your rain delay seems to be over.''</p><p>Half an hour later, having realized that the expected staccato clicking of keys hadn't yet begun, Tony pushed open the door to Henry's office. Standing on the threshold, he noted that nothing showed on the monitor but a chapter heading and a lot of blank screen.</p><p>"This spook really has you spooked, doesn't it?''</p><p>"Why do you say that?'' Henry asked without turning.</p><p>"You're just sitting there, staring at your hands.''</p><p>"Maybe I was deep in thought.''</p><p>"Henry, you write bodice rippers. There's a limit to how much deep thought is allowed.''</p><p>Seventeen years a royal duke, over four hundred and fifty years a vampire, it had taken Henry a while to recognize when he was being teased. Once or twice, Tony had come close to not surviving the adjustment. Lifting his gaze from his hands, he sighed. </p><p>"All I can think of is, why me.'' He laughed, but the sound held no humor. "Which seems a little self-centered since I'm merely being haunted and was not the one killed and mutilated.'' Pushing his ergonomic chair away from the desk, he spun it around and stood. </p><p>"I need to get out. Be distracted.''</p><p>"Great.'' Tony grinned. "Bram Stoker's <i>Dracula</i> is playing at midnight at the Caprice.''</p><p>"Why not.'' Enjoying Tony's poleaxed expression, Henry turned the young man about and pushed him gently out of the doorway. "I hear Gary Oldman is terrific.''</p><p>"<i>You</i> hear?'' Tony sputtered as Henry's inarguable touch moved him down the hall. "You heard it from me! And when I told you, you told me that you never go to vampire movies--<i>that's</i> why not.''</p><p>"I changed my mind.'' Unable to resist, he added, "Maybe we can get a bite while we're downtown.''</p><p>The elevators in the Pacific Place towers were as fast and as quiet as money could make them. With his fingertips resting lightly on the brushed steel doors, Henry cocked his head and smiled. "It sounds like Lisa's shredding the character of another cabbie.''</p><p>Tony winced. "Man, I'm glad she likes <i>us</i>. ''</p><p>As the chime announced the arrival of the elevator, the two men stepped away from the doors.</p><p>"Hello, boys.'' One gloved hand clutching the arm of her paid companion, Lisa Evans grinned a very expensive and perfect grin as she shuffled into the corridor. The gleaming white teeth between glistening red lips added a ghastly emphasis to the skull-like effect created when age finally triumphed over years of cosmetic surgery. "Heading out for a late night on the town?''</p><p>"Just a midnight movie,'' Henry told her as Tony stopped the doors from closing. He scooped up her free hand and raised it to his lips. "And you, I expect, have been out breaking hearts?''</p><p>"At my age? Don't be ridiculous.'' She pulled her hand free and smacked him lightly on the cheek, then turned on her companion. "And what are you smiling about, Munro?''</p><p>Not the least bit chastised, Mrs. Munro continued to smile down at her elderly employer. "I was just thinking about Mr. Swanson.''</p><p>"Swanson's interested in my money, not these old bones.'' But she preened a little and patted the head of the mink stole she wore over a raw silk suit. Once the mistress of a Vancouver lumber baron, she'd made a number of shrewd investments and parlayed a comfortable nest egg into a tidy fortune. "And besides, I'm not interested in him. All the good men are dead.'' Sweeping a twinkling gaze over Henry and Tony, she added, "Or gay.''</p><p>"Miss Evans!''</p><p>"Chill out, Munro. I'm not telling them anything they don't know.'' Companion chastised, she turned her attention back to the two men. "We've just come from one of those tedious fund-raising things they expect you to attend when you have money. Organs, I think it was tonight.''</p><p>"Organs?'' Henry repeated with a smile, fully aware that Lisa Evans enjoyed those tedious fund-raising things where her checkbook ensured she'd be stroked and flattered. He also knew that if she was vague, it was deliberate--no one made the kind of money she had without knowing exactly where every dollar ended up. "Musical or medical?''</p><p>"Medical.'' Heavily shadowed eyes narrowed into a look that had been known to send a variety of CEOs running for cover. "Have you signed an organ donor card?''</p><p>"I'm afraid they wouldn't want my organs.''</p><p>The look softened slightly as she leaped to the conclusion he'd intended. "Oh. I'm sorry. Still, while there's life, there's hope, and medical science is doing wonders these days.'' She grinned. "I mean, it's a wonder I'm still alive.'' Pulling her companion down the hall, rather in the manner of a pilot boat guiding a tanker into harbor, she threw a cheery, "Don't do anything I wouldn't do,'' back over her shoulder.</p><p>"Well, that leaves us a lot of leeway,'' Henry murmured as the elevator door closed on Mrs. Munro's continuing shocked protests.</p><p>Tony sagged against the back wall, hands shoved in his pockets. ` Maybe you should send your ghost over to her.''</p><p>"Why?''</p><p>"If all the good men ...</p></p><h2>A Test of Wills</h2><p>Scotland Yard Inspector Ian Rutledge returns home suffering from shellshock and the emotional strains of World War I, but he soon goes back to work and must solve a murder case involving the killing of a retired military officer, a crime in which the main suspect is a highly decorated war hero</p><p>Having just returned from France after World War I with a medal of honor and serious shell shock, Inspector Ian Rutledge struggles to settle back into his duties at Scotland Yard.

They found grounds for dispute over trade practices, territorial control, and the complicated loyalties among the various Indian tribes and European powers. Over the years, the Cherokees struggled to maintain their ancient traditions as the tribe was assimilated into the white man&#x2019;s culture. <em>Cherokee Voices</em>&nbsp;uses the participants&#x2019; own words to tell the story of early Cherokee life. The selections were gathered from journals, treaty records, and correspondence written by Cherokees or by Europeans or Americans who knew them. The excerpts begin with the 1730 visit of Alexander Cuming, who appointed an &#x201c;emperor&#x201d; for the Cherokees. Touching on matters as varied as the Cherokees&#x2019; oral tradition, their village life, their ball games, their treaties with white settlers, their famous&nbsp;<i>Cherokee Phoenix</i>&nbsp;newspaper, and their education in Christian mission schools, the chapters take readers from when the Cherokees were dependent on European trade to when they became self-sufficient farmers and tradesmen. Unlike most books about the Cherokees, written in the third person by authors who lived years after the events, this one recognizes that no one can speak more eloquently of their lives, trials, and customs than the people themselves.</p> <p>Vicki Rozema is the author of <em>Footsteps of the Cherokees: A Guide to the Eastern Homelands of the Cherokee Nation</em> and <em>Voices from the Trail of Tears</em>.

She also has an insomniac toddler, a precocious, death-obsessed seven-year-old, and a frequently-absent ecologist husband who has brought them all to Colsay, a desolate island in the Hebrides, so he can count the puffins. Ferociously sleep-deprived, torn between mothering and her desire for the pleasures of work and solitude, Anna becomes haunted by the discovery of a baby&#39;s skeleton in the garden of their house. Her narrative is punctuated by letters home, written 200 years before, by May, a young, middle-class midwife desperately trying to introduce modern medicine to the suspicious, insular islanders. The lives of these two characters intersect unexpectedly in this deeply moving but also at times blackly funny story about maternal ambivalence, the way we try to control children, and about women&#39;s vexed and passionate relationship with work.Moss&#39;s second novel displays an exciting expansion of her range - showing her to be both an excellent comic writer, and a novelist of great emotional depth.</p><p>Sarah Moss is a lecturer of English and American Literature at the University of Kent.

They spend the night</p> <p> murmuring oboe harmonies to each other, a woodwind of</p> <p> reassurance. Ordinary swans, the Queen&#x2019;s swans on the river</p> <p> where we feed the ducks at home, have faces apparently</p> <p> afflicted by some medieval disease, and sleep standing on one</p> <p> leg, heads under their wings like child-free passengers on</p> <p> long-haul flights who can summon night with a nylon blindfold.</p> <p> These sea swans seem to stay awake all night, sailing</p> <p> through the fading light like ships bound for far countries, and</p> <p> they have faces as smooth and neutral as the <i>corps de ballet</i>, faces</p> <p> that can&#x2019;t communicate any level of grief or pain. Perhaps this</p> <p> is an asset in species that mate for life.</p> <p> I glance back at the house. Its fa�ade, dark as the cliff-face</p> <p> at the other end of the island, turns away from the after-light</p> <p> shining over the sea, from where America is coming up for a</p> <p> new day as we turn away from the sun. One of the swans</p> <p> stretches towards the sky and cries out, wings threshing the water</p> <p> in sudden agitation like that of someone who has just remembered</p> <p> that a friend is dead. I saw a goose dying, once, a Canada</p> <p> goose that had flown all the way from the Arctic to end its life on</p> <p> the hard shoulder of the M40, and although one wing was still</p> <p> beating as if to music while the other lay across the rumble-strip,</p> <p> its face was impassive. I stood on the footbridge, watching, joggling</p> <p> the pram in which the baby would sleep only for as long</p> <p> as we kept moving, until some lorry driver, merciful or inattentive,</p> <p> left a flurry of feathers and red jam on the road. Our swans</p> <p> are safe from that, here. For a season. Like us, they will go south</p> <p> in the autumn, but for now there are no cars, no roads. No</p> <p> bridges, either. The stars are coming out in the darkening sky</p> <p> over the hill. I shiver; not cold, exactly, but time to go in.</p></p><h2>So Many Gifts</h2><p>Tells how Santa Claus decided on his life&#39;s work and chose assistants to help him distribute gifts to children when his work became too much for him to handle alone</p><p></p><h2>How to Land an A330 Airbus: And Other Vital Skills for the Modern Man</h2><p><p>Being given yet another pointless 'man manual' that told him fifty ways to tie a bow tie in under 30 seconds made James May, co-presenter of <i>The Grand Tour</i>, certain there was a need for another kind of book.

There are only nine topics, but they are not, as far as I can discern, covered anywhere else. That makes this book indispensable in a sea of duplicated "how to" manuals, the one tin of fortifying Spam in the post-apocalyptic corner shop of putrefying groceries.</p> <p>The chances that you will ever meet with the circumstances outlined here are, frankly, very remote.

To the south, the Strait of Magellan is one of the most difficult journeys in the world; it seemed only reasonable to expect that a more comfortable alternative would lie to the north.<p> In the event, of course, the world is not designed for human comfort, and the Northwest Passage is incredibly arduous and not particularly useful. But the search motivated Arctic exploration and adventure for hundreds of years, and inspired many gripping or tragic adventures. Arctic archeologist James Delgado relates these tales--the voyages of the Norsemen, Henry Hudson, Sir John Franklin, and others--with a rare combination of verve, historical context, and lots of illustrations. Maps, photos, and images from different eras make <i>Across the Top of the World</i> a fascinating book for browsing or for concentrated reading. It's an invaluable companion--reference, atlas, and history--to any other book about polar exploration and adventure. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><strong>James P.

In the end, she was the one who caught him...and tortured him...and then let him go. Why did Gretchen spare Archie's life and then turn herself in? This is the question that keeps him up all night&#x2015;and the reason why he has visited Gretchen in prison every week since.</p><p>Meanwhile, another series of murders is tearing up the Portland streets. Archie seems to be getting closer to solving this high-profile case...until he finds himself in a fatal collision course with the killer&#x2015;one that inevitably leads him back to his former captor. Gretchen may be the only one who can help do justice. The only thing she can't do, this time, is save Archie's life.</p></p><p>Chelsea Cain steps into a crowded, blood-soaked genre with <i>Heartsick</i>, a riveting, character-driven novel about a damaged cop and his obsession with the serial killer who...let him live. Gretchen Lowell tortured Detective Archie Sheridan for ten days, then inexplicably let him go and turned herself in. Cain turns the (nearly played out) Starling/Lecter relationship on its ear: Sheridan must face down his would-be killer to help hunt down another. What sets this disturbing novel apart from the rest is its bruised, haunted heart in the form of Detective Sheridan, a bewildered survivor trying to catch a killer and save himself. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br> <p></p> <p> <strong>Questions for Chelsea Cain</strong> </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Gretchen Lowell haunts every page of <i>Heartsick</i>. Even when she actually appears in the jail scenes with Sheridan, she reveals nothing, and yet it's obvious she's anything but one-dimensional. What is her story? </p><p> <strong>Cain:</strong> I purposely didn't reveal Gretchen's past, beyond a few unreliable hints. I thought there was a really interesting tension in not knowing what had driven this woman to embrace violence so enthusiastically. The less we know about killers' motives, the scarier they are. Maybe that's why people spend so much time watching 24-hour news channels that cover the latest horrible domestic murder. We want to understand why people kill. Because if we can peg it on something, we can tell ourselves that they are different than us, that we aren't capable of that kind of brutality. Plus this is the launch of a series and I thought it would be fun for readers to get to learn more about Gretchen as the series continues. I just finished <i>Sweetheart</i>, and I promise there's a lot more Gretchen to come. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> As a first-time thriller author, you've got to be elated to see early reviews evoke the legendary Hannibal Lecter. Did you anticipate readers to make that connection, or are there other serial series (on paper or screen) that inspired the story of Gretchen and Sheridan? </p><p> <strong>Cain:</strong> I thought that the connection to Lecter was inevitable since <i>Heartsick</i> features a detective who visits a jailed serial killer. But I wasn't consciously inspired by <i>Silence of the Lambs</i> (or <i>Red Dragon</i>, which is the Harris book it more accurately echoes). I grew up in the Pacific Northwest when the Green River Killer was at large, and I was fascinated by the relationship between a cop who'd spent his career hunting a killer (as many of the cops on the Green River Task Force did) and the killer he ends up catching. I'd seen an episode of Larry King that featured two of the Green River Task Force cops and they had footage of one of the cops with Gary Ridgway (the Green River Killer) in jail and they were chatting like old friends. They were both trying to manipulate one another. The cop wanted Ridgway to tell him where more bodies were. Ridgway is a psychopath and wanted to feel in control. But on the surface, they seemed like buddies having a drink together at a bar. It was kind of disturbing. I wanted to explore that. Making the killer a woman was a way to make the relationship even more intense. Making her a very attractive woman upped the ante considerably. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Reading <i>Heartsick</i> I was actually reminded of some of my favorite books by Stephen King. Like him, you have an uncanny ability to make your geographical setting feel like a character all its own. Do you think the story could have happened in any other place than Portland? </p><p><strong>Cain:</strong> <i>Heartsick</i> Hawaii would definitely have been a different book. (Archie Sheridan would have been a surfer. Susan would have worked at a gift shop. And Gretchen would have been a deranged hula girl.) I live in Portland, so obviously that played into my decision to set the book here. All I had to do was look out the window. Which makes research a lot easier. But I also think that the Pacific Northwest makes a great setting for a thriller, and it's not a setting that's usually explored. Portland is so beautiful. But it&#x2019;s also sort of eerie. The evergreens, the coast, the mountains--the scale is so huge, and the scenery is so magnificent. But every year hikers get lost and die, kids are killed by sneaker waves on the beach, and mountain climbers get crushed by avalanches. Beauty kills. Plus it has always seemed like the Northwest is teeming with serial killers. I blame the cloud cover. And the coffee. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> In a lot of ways, <i>Heartsick</i> is more about the killer than the killings, and it&#x2019;s hard not to suspect that Gretchen killed only to get to Sheridan. That begs the question: is the chase always better than the catch? As a writer, is it more exciting for you to imagine the pursuit--with its tantalizing push-and-pull--than the endgame? </p><p> <strong>Cain:</strong> The most interesting aspect of the book to me is the relationship between Archie and Gretchen. Really, I wrote the whole book as an excuse to explore that. The endgame is satisfying because it's fun to see all the threads come together, but it's the relationship that keeps coming back to the computer day after day. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Your characters--Susan Ward in particular--are raw, tautly wired, imperfect but still have this irresistible tenderness. It's their motives and experiences that really drive the story and ultimately elevate it way beyond what you might expect going into a serial killer tale. How did you resist falling into something more formulaic? Did you know what shape Susan and the others would take going in? </p><p> <strong>Cain:</strong> I knew I wanted flawed protagonists. I'm a sucker for a Byronic hero. Thrillers often feature such square-jawed hero types, and I wanted a story about people just barely hanging on. The psychological component is really interesting to me, and I liked that Susan's neuroses are, in their own ways, clues. In many ways, I embraced formula. I love formula--there&#x2019;s a reason it works. And I decided early on that I wasn't going to avoid clich�s for the sake of avoiding them. Some clich�s are great. My goal was not to write a literary thriller, but to take all the stuff I loved from other books and TV shows and throw them all together and then try to put my own spin on it. <i>Heartsick</i> is a pulpy page-turner with, I hope, a little extra effort put into the writing and the characters. Basically, I just wrote the thriller that I wanted to read. </p><p></p> (photo credit: Kate Eshelby) <p></p> <br>Damaged Portland detective Archie Sheridan spent ten years tracking Gretchen Lowell, a beautiful serial killer, but in the end she was the one who caught him. Two years ago, Gretchen kidnapped Archie and tortured him for ten days, but instead of killing him, she mysteriously decided to let him go. She turned herself in, and now Gretchen has been locked away for the rest of her life, while Archie is in a prison of another kind---addicted to pain pills, unable to return to his old life, powerless to get those ten horrific days off his mind. Archie's a different person, his estranged wife says, and he knows she's right. He continues to visit Gretchen in prison once a week, saying that only he can get her to confess as to the whereabouts of more of her victims, but even he knows the truth---he can't stay away.<br>When another killer begins snatching teenage girls off the streets of Portland, Archie has to pull himself together enough to lead the new task force investigating the murders. A hungry young newspaper reporter, Susan Ward, begins profiling Archie and the investigation, which sparks a deadly game between Archie, Susan, the new killer, and even Gretchen. They need to catch a killer, and maybe somehow then Archie can free himself from Gretchen, once and for all. Either way, "Heartsick" makes for one of the most extraordinary suspense debuts in recent memory.</p><h2>Farmer Boy Days (Little House Chapter Book)</h2><p>After spending a day on the farm helping his father tend to the animals and train the calves, Almanzo Wilder decides that he, too, wants to be a farmer when he grows up. Simultaneous.</p><p><p>Laura Ingalls Wilder (1867&#x2013;1957) was born in a log cabin in the Wisconsin woods. With her family, she pioneered throughout America&#x2019;s heartland during the 1870s and 1880s, finally settling in Dakota Territory. She married Almanzo Wilder in 1885; their only daughter, Rose, was born the following year. The Wilders moved to Rocky Ridge Farm at Mansfield, Missouri, in 1894, where they established a permanent home. After years of farming, Laura wrote the first of her beloved Little House books in 1932. The nine Little House books are international classics.

Her children's books include<i> Miss Fannie's Hat</i> and <i>Jeremy: The Tale of an Honest Bunny</i>.<b><i>One</i></b> <br><br> <b><i>T</i></b>he rain began punctually at five o�clock, though few were awake to hear it. It was a gentle rain, rather like a summer shower that had escaped the grip of time or season and wandered into Mitford several months late.<p> By six o�clock, when much of the population of 1,074 was leaving for work in Wesley or Holding or across the Tennessee line, the drops had grown large and heavy, as if weighted with mercury, and those running to their cars or trucks without umbrellas could feel the distinct smack of each drop. </p><p> Dashing to a truck outfitted with painter�s ladders, someone on Lilac Road shouted �<i>Yee</i>haw!,� an act that precipitated a spree of barking among the neighborhood dogs. </p><p> Here and there, as seemingly random as the appearance of stars at twilight, lamps came on in houses throughout the village, and radio and television voices prophesied that the front passing over the East Coast would be firmly lodged there for two days. </p><p> More than a few were fortunate to lie in bed and listen to the rain drumming on the roof, relieved to have no reason to get up until they were plenty good and ready. </p><p> Others thanked God for the time that remained to lie in a warm, safe place unmolested by worldly cares, while some began at once to fret about what the day might bring. </p><p> Father Timothy Kavanagh, one of the earliest risers in Mitford, did not rise so early this morning. Instead, he lay in his bed in the yellow house on Wisteria Lane and listened to the aria of his wife�s whiffling snore, mingled with the sound of rain churning through the gutters. </p><p> Had he exchanged wedding vows before the age of sixty-two, he might have taken the marriage bed for granted after these seven years. Instead, he seldom awakened next to the warm sentience of his wife without being mildly astonished by her presence, and boundlessly grateful. Cynthia was his best friend and boon companion, dropped from the very heavens into his life, which, forthwith, she had changed utterly. </p><p> He would get up soon enough and go about his day, first hying with his good dog, Barnabas, into the pouring rain, and then, while the coffee brewed, reading the Morning Office, as he�d done for more than four decades as both a working and a now-retired priest. </p><p> Feeling a light chill in the room, he scooted over to his sleeping wife and put his arm around her and held her close, comforted, as ever, by the faint and familiar scent of wisteria. <br><br> <b>a</b><br> Lew Boyd, who liked to rise with the sun every morning, and who always wore his watch to bed, gazed at the luminous face of his Timex and saw that it was the first day of October. </p><p> October! He had no idea at all where the time had gone. Yesterday was July, today was October. As a matter of fact, where had his life gone? </p><p> He stared at the bedroom ceiling and pondered a question that he�d never been fond of messing with, though now seemed a good time to do it and get it over with. </p><p> One day, he�d been a green kid without a care in the world. Then, before you could say Jack Robinson, he�d looked up and found he was an old codger with a new and secret wife living way off in Tennessee with her mama, and him lying here in this cold, lonesome bed just as he�d been doing all those years as a widower. </p><p> He tried to recall what, exactly, had happened between his youth and old age, but without a cup of coffee at the very least, he was drawing a blank. </p><p> Though he�d worked hard and saved his money and honored his dead wife�s memory by looking at her picture on Sunday and paying to have her grave weed-eated, he didn�t know whether he�d made a go of it with the Good Lord or not. </p><p> For the few times he�d cheated somebody down at his Exxon station, he�d asked forgiveness, even though he�d cheated them only a few bucks. He�d also asked forgiveness for the times he�d bitten Juanita�s head off without good reason, and for a few other things he didn�t want to think about ever again. </p><p> To top that off, he�d quit smoking twelve years ago, cut out the peach brandy he�d fooled with after Juanita passed, and increased what he put in the plate on the occasional Sundays he showed up at First Baptist. </p><p> But the thing was, it seemed like all of it�good and bad, up and down, sweet and sour�had blown by him like Dale Earnhardt Jr. at Talladega. </p><p> He sighed deeply, hauled himself out of bed, and slid his cold feet into the unlaced, brown and white spectators he wore around the house. If Juanita was alive, or if Earlene was here, he�d probably turn on the furnace out of common decency. But as long as he was boss of the thermostat, he�d operate on the fact that an oil furnace was money down the drain and wait �til the first hard freeze to make himself toasty. </p><p> Sitting on the side of the bed and covering his bare legs with the blanket, he scratched his head and yawned, then reached for the cordless and punched redial. </p><p> When his wife, living with her dying mama in a frame house on the southern edge of Knoxville, answered the phone, he said, �Good mornin�, dumplin.�� </p><p> �Good mornin� yourself, baby. How�re you feelin� this mornin�?� <br> �Great!� he said. �Just <i>great!</i>�<br><br> He thought for a split second he was telling a bald-faced lie, then realized he was telling the lawful truth. It was the sound of Earlene�s cheerful voice that had changed him from an old man waking up in a cold bed to a young buck who just remembered he was driving to Tennessee in his new Dodge truck, tonight.<br><br> <b>a</b><br> At six-thirty, Hope Winchester dashed along Main Street under a red umbrella. Rain gurgled from the downspouts of the buildings she fled past and flowed along the curb in a bold and lively stream. </p><p> To the driver of a station wagon heading down the mountain, the figure hurrying past the Main Street Grill was but a splash of red on the canvas of a sullen, gray morning. Nonetheless, it was a splash that momentarily cheered the driver. </p><p> Hope dodged a billow of water from the wheels of the station wagon and clutched even tighter the pocketbook containing three envelopes whose contents could change her life forever. She would line them up on her desk in the back room of the bookstore and prayerfully examine each of these wonders again and again. Then she would put them in her purse at the end of the day and take them home and line them up on her kitchen table so she might do the same thing once more. </p><p> UPS had come hours late yesterday with the books to be used in this month�s promotion, which meant she�d lost precious time finishing the front window and must get at it this morning before the bookstore opened at ten. It was, after all, October first�time for a whole new window display, and the annual Big O sale. </p><p> All titles beginning with the letter <i>O</i> would be twenty percent off, which would get Wesley�s students and faculty hopping! Indeed, September�s Big S sale had increased their bottom line by twelve percent over last year, and all because she, the usually reticent Hope Winchester, had urged the owner to give a percentage off that really �counted for something.� It was a Books-A-Million, B&amp;N, Sam�s Club kind of world, Hope insisted, and a five-percent dribble here and there wouldn�t work anymore, not even in Mitford, which wasn�t as sleepy and innocuous as some people liked to think. </p><p> She dashed under the awning, set her streaming umbrella down, and jiggled the key in the door of Willard Porter�s old pharmacy, now known as Happy Endings Books. </p><p> The lock had the cunning possessed only by a lock manufactured in 1927. Helen, the owner, had refused to replace it, insisting that a burglar couldn�t possibly outwit its boundless vagaries. </p><p> Jiggling diligently, Hope realized that her feet were cold and soaking wet. She supposed that�s what she deserved by wearing sandals past Labor Day, something her mother had often scolded her for doing. </p><p> Once inside, and against the heartfelt wishes of Helen, who lived in Florida and preferred to delay heating the shop until the first snow, Hope squished to the thermostat and looked at the temperature: fifty degrees. Who would read a book, much less buy one, at fifty degrees? </p><p> As Margaret Ann, the bookstore cat, wound around her ankles, Hope turned the dial to �on.� </p><p> The worn hardwood floor trembled slightly, and she heard at once the great boiler in the basement give its thunderous annual greeting to autumn in Mitford. <br><br> <b>a</b><br> Uncle Billy Watson lay with his eyes squeezed shut and listened to the rain pounding the roof of the Mitford town museum, the rear portion of which he and Rose called home. </p><p> He was glad it was raining, for two reasons. </p><p> One, he figured it would make the ground nice and soft to plant th� three daffodil bulbs Dora Pugh had trotted to �is door. Th� bulbs, if they was like her seeds, wouldn�t be fit to plant, but he�d give �er one more chance to do th� honorable thing an� stand by what she sold. </p><p> When he was feelin� stronger an� the doc would let him poke around outside, he knowed right where he�d plant to make the finest show�at the bottom of th� back steps, over to th� left where the mailman wouldn�t tear up jack when he made �is deliveries. </p><p> Feeling the gooseflesh rise along his arms and legs, he pulled the covers to his chin. </p><p> Th� other good thing about the rain, if hit lasted, was when Betty Craig come to nurse �im t�day, she�d be cookin� all manner of rations to make a man�s jaws water. If they was anything better�n hearin� rain on th� roof an� smellin� good cookin� at the same time, he didn�t know what hit�d be. </p><p> He lay perfectly still, listening now to the beating of his heart. </p><p> His heart wasn�t floppin� around thisaway and thataway n� more, he reckoned the pills was workin�. </p><p> In a little bit, he rolled over and covered his ears to shut out the sound of his wife�s snoring in the next bed. </p><p> He might�ve lost a good deal of eyesight an� some control of �is bladder, don�t you know, but by jing, �is hearin� could still pick up a cricket in th� grass, thank th� ...</p></p><h2>The Death of Death: Resurrection and Immortality in Jewish Thought</h2><p><p><b>Does death end life, or is it the passage from one stage of life to another? </b></p><p>In <em>The Death of Death,</em> noted theologian Neil Gillman offers readers an original and compelling argument that Judaism, a religion often thought to pay little attention to the afterlife, not only presents us with rich ideas on this subject&#x2015;but delivers a deathblow to death itself.</p><p>Combining astute scholarship with keen historical, theological and liturgical insights, Gillman outlines the evolution of Jewish thought about bodily resurrection and spiritual immortality. Beginning with the near-silence of the Bible on the afterlife, he traces the development of these two doctrines through Jewish history. He also describes why today, somewhat surprisingly, more contemporary Jewish scholars&#x2015;including Gillman&#x2015;have unabashedly reaffirmed the notion of bodily resurrection.</p><p>In this innovative and personal synthesis, Gillman creates a strikingly modern statement on resurrection and immortality.</p><p><em>The Death of Death</em> gives new and fascinating life to an ancient debate. This new work is an intellectual and spiritual milestone for all of us interested in the meaning of life, as well as the meaning of death.</p></p><p><p><strong>Neil Gillman</strong>, rabbi and PhD, is professor of Jewish philosophy at The Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, where he has served as chair of the Department of Jewish Philosophy and dean of the Rabbinical School. He is author of <em>Believing and Its Tensions: A Personal Conversation about God, Torah, Suffering and Death in Jewish Thought</em>;<em> The Death of Death: Resurrection and Immortality in Jewish Thought,</em> a finalist for the National Jewish Book Award and a <em>Publishers Weekly</em> "Best Book of the Year"; <em>The Way Into Encountering God in Judaism</em>;<em> The Jewish Approach to God: A Brief Introduction for Christians</em>; <em>Traces of God: Seeing God in Torah, History and Everyday Life</em> (all Jewish Lights) and <em>Sacred Fragments: Recovering Theology for the Modern Jew,</em> winner of the National Jewish Book Award.</p>Birth and death represent the twin terminals of life. That death represents the end-point of human life is, in fact, the view of much of biblical religion....In time, in the second century BCE, Judaism came to assert that death may represent one event within the framework of human life, but not the final event. This later Jewish tradition broadens the time-frame of human destiny.</p><h2>Beyond Suspicion (Jack Swyteck Novel, 2)</h2><p>Believing himself settled into a quiet and happy life, lawyer Jack Swyteck is horrified when a former client turns up dead, placing Jack under suspicion, compromising his marriage, and forcing him to find the real killer before he becomes the next victim. Reprint.</p><p>When Jack Swytech's former girlfriend asks him to defend her in a case brought by investors who advance payment on insurance policies when their beneficiaries have been diagnosed with a terminal condition, it looks like an easy win; Jessie Merrill wasn't dying after all, but since Viatical Settlements accepted her doctor's somewhat equivocal diagnosis, they don't stand a chance of getting their money back. Still celebrating his victory, Jack learns that Jessie has lied to him; like the shady, possibly Mob-connected company that advanced Jessie the money, he's been scammed. Then Jessie is murdered in a bizarre scenario that not only sets Jack up as the prime suspect but also threatens his marriage to the woman who is still traumatized by a vicious attack perpetrated by another of his erstwhile clients. Enlisting the aid of his best friend, an ex-con who will do anything to protect the man who saved him from death row, Jack attempts to clear his name by finding the real murderer, who turns out to have a secret worth killing for. The serpentine plot manages to hold the reader's attention despite characters who seem drawn from central casting and a meandering pace that doesn't exactly compel one to keep turning pages to unravel the mystery. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p>James Grippando is a <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author of suspense.

He lives with his wife, the novelist Tabitha King, in Bangor, Maine.YA Four novels published between 1977 and 1982. In Rage , a high-school student goes berserk in the classroom, killing the teacher and holding the class hostage. Set in a militaristic ultra-conservative America, The Long Walk pits 100 teenagers against each other in a grueling 450-mile marathon walk in which the penalty is death. Roadwork is a novel of societal conflict, man vs. progress. The first three thrillers, while entertaining and gripping, occasionally suffer from unfocused and uneven writing. Unresolved questions cause them to be somewhat unsatisfying. However the fourth novel, The Running Man , in the tradition of Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (NAL, 1968; o.p.), is an action-packed futuristic romp. Protagonist Ben Richards bets his life on a TV show in order to win the money to save the life of his deathly ill daughter. The story combines social commentary, adventure and science fiction, set against the backdrop of a decaying society. This one novel is well worth the price of the book. The name Stephen King, plus the four-novels-in-one packaging guarantees this volume's success. Bet you can't buy just one copy!

I love doing both! No matter the occasion, gatherings at my home always start with some fantastic appetizers. Delicious dips, piping-hot poppers, and crispy potato skins are just some of the starters I&#x2019;ve included in this chapter. All are easy. All are tasty. And all are sure to keep your guests coming back for more.<br><br> I usually figure on four or five appetizers per person with before-dinner cocktails. Give your guests just enough small bites to tempt their appetites, but also leave room for the rest of the meal you&#x2019;ve prepared. If I&#x2019;m throwing an appetizers-and-drinks-only party, then I double the amount of appetizers.<br><br> The secret to throwing memorable parties? Organization. That means planning ahead. Way ahead. Creatively balance your menu with made-the-day-before dips and hot appetizers. Do as much prepping and cooking ahead of time as you can. You don&#x2019;t want to spend the entire party pulling trays of Cheddar-Ham Cups, Skewered Buffalo Chicken Tenders, and Chicken Nachos from the oven while everyone else is laughing it up in the living room. Dips taste best when made in advance so the flavors have time to develop. Fill and fry the Cheeseburger Dumplings a day or two ahead, then pop them in the oven when the first guests ring your doorbell. Then get the party started!<br><br> guacamole cups<br><br> with pico de gallo<br><br> When you&#x2019;re hosting a party, it&#x2019;s fun to make dishes that are &#x201c;out of the box.&#x201d; This recipe is one of those&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s right out of a muffin pan. Your guests will think you spent hours making these cups, but actually, the process is simple. Just press egg roll wrappers (look for them in the produce section of your grocery store) into a mini muffin pan and bake. The filling for these cups is a classic, garlicky guacamole topped with a bit of pico de gallo&#x2014;a fresh salsa. Some folks like a smooth guacamole, others chunky. I like the best of both worlds&#x2014;smooth with a little chunkiness. Concerned about the heat? Cut back on the jalape�o.<br><br> Makes 36 cups<br><br> Vegetable oil spray<br><br> 1 pound package egg roll wrappers<br><br> 4 ripe avocados<br><br> Juice of 1 lime<br><br> 3/4 cup jarred pico de gallo<br><br> 3 garlic cloves, minced<br><br> 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil<br><br> 1 teaspoon seeded and minced jalape�o<br><br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br><br> 1 cup (8 ounces) sour cream<br><br> Cilantro sprigs<br><br> Preheat the oven to 350�F. Spray mini muffin pans with the vegetable oil spray. If you have just one muffin pan, the cups will need to be made in batches.<br><br> Cut the egg roll wrappers into quarters. Place a square in each of 36 mini muffin cups, gently pressing the wrappers against the bottoms and sides. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes, until light golden brown. Remove the cups from the pan and cool on a wire rack.<br><br> Halve the avocados, remove the pits, and scoop out the flesh into a bowl. Sprinkle the avocados with the lime juice.<br><br> Add the pico de gallo, garlic, olive oil, jalape�o, and salt. Using a fork, mash the mixture to the desired smoothness or chunkiness. Fill each egg roll cup with a spoonful of the guacamole. Top each one with a bit of the sour cream and a sprig of cilantro before serving.<br><br> white bean and<br><br> sun-dried tomato dip<br><br> When you&#x2019;re asked to bring an appetizer to a party or a family gathering, wow them with this easy-to-put-together dip. Pops of color from sun-dried tomatoes and bright green herbs make this savory spread a winner, and guests will no doubt hit you up for the recipe.<br><br> Makes 3 cups<br><br> 1 15-ounce can cannellini beans, drained and rinsed<br><br> 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br><br> 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil<br><br> 2 garlic cloves<br><br> 1 teaspoon onion powder<br><br> Pinch of cayenne<br> 1 3- to 4-ounce jar sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil, drained and patted dry<br><br> 1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary<br><br> 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br><br> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br><br> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives<br><br> Toasted pita chips<br><br> Put the beans, lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, onion powder, cayenne, sun-dried tomatoes, rosemary, salt, and black pepper in a food processor. Pulse until the mixture is smooth.<br><br> Put the dip in a serving bowl. Before serving, garnish with the chives and serve with a basket of toasted pita chips. The dip can be refrigerated up to one to two days.<br><br> artichoke-spinach dip<br><br> in a bread bowl<br><br> While you&#x2019;ll find this popular appetizer in many restaurants, you&#x2019;ll be surprised how easy it is to make at home. The hardest part is hollowing out the bread and not eating all the pieces!<br><br> Makes 4 cups<br><br> 1 8-ounce package cream cheese, at room temperature<br><br> 1/4 cup mayonnaise<br><br> 1/4 cup (1 ounce) freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano<br><br> 1/4 cup (1 ounce) freshly grated Pecorino Romano<br><br> 1 garlic clove, minced<br><br> 1/2 teaspoon dried basil<br><br> 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt<br><br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste<br><br> 1 14-ounce can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped<br><br> 1 10-ounce package chopped frozen spinach, thawed, drained, and squeezed dry<br><br> 1/3 cup (21/2 ounces) shredded mozzarella<br><br> Bread bowl (see below) or pita chips<br><br> Preheat the oven to 350�F.

Gently stir in the artichoke hearts and spinach. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the mozzarella on top.<br><br> Bake for 25 minutes, until bubbly and lightly browned on top. Transfer the dip to a bread bowl (if using) or serve warm with pita chips or small toast.<br><br> cheesy pepperoni dip<br><br> with pizza dippers<br><br> One of my favorite foods on the planet is pizza. I love it hot. I love it cold. Thin or thick crust. In any form or fashion. In true foodie tradition, I also love being creative with pizza. This recipe includes everything I want in my pie&#x2014;in the form of a mouthwatering dip. It&#x2019;s cheesy, it&#x2019;s flavorful, and it&#x2019;s fun.<br><br> Makes 32 dippers<br><br> Pizza Crust Dippers<br><br> 2/3 cup (about 2 ounces) freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano<br><br> 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning<br><br> 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br><br> 2 13.8-ounce cans refrigerated pizza dough<br><br> 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil<br><br> Cheesy Pepperoni Dip<br><br> 12 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature<br><br> 1/2 cup (4 ounces) sour cream<br><br> 2 teaspoons dried oregano<br><br> 1 teaspoon dried basil<br><br> 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br><br> 1 garlic clove, minced<br><br> 3/4 cup prepared pizza or tomato sauce<br><br> 11/3 cup chopped pepperoni<br><br> 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper<br><br> 1/4 cup sliced scallions<br><br> 3/4 cup (3 ounces) shredded Cheddar<br><br> 3/4 cup (3 ounces) plus 1/4 cup (1 ounce) shredded mozzarella<br><br> Preheat the oven to 425�F.<br><br> To make the dippers, combine the Parmesan, Italian seasoning, and garlic powder in a bowl. Set aside. Roll out one pizza dough on a lightly floured work surface and cut into 18 squares. Then cut each square in half diagonally to form 2 triangles. Arrange the triangles on a baking sheet and brush each one with olive oil. Sprinkle the Parmesan mixture over the triangles. Repeat with the remaining pizza dough. There will be a total of 72 triangles. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until golden brown. Remove to a wire rack to cool.<br><br> To make the dip, whisk together the cream cheese, sour cream, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, garlic, pizza sauce, pepperoni, bell pepper, scallions, Cheddar, and 3/4 cup of the mozzarella in a bowl. Evenly spread out the mixture in a shallow 2-quart ovenproof dish.<br><br> Bake for 15 minutes, until bubbly. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup mozzarella. Bake for 5 minutes more. Serve hot with the dippers.<br><br> chicken nachos<br><br> You know how I love to feed crowds. Well, one of my all-time favorite crowd-pleasers is a ginormous platter of my cheesy, zippy, crunchy nachos. While nachos are often made with ground beef, I like to mix things up every once in a while by using shredded chicken for a different flavor profile.

Who was this extraordinary priest and how did he become adept at hiding Jews, providing them with false papers, and helping them to elude their persecutors? From monasteries first in Marseille and later in Rome, P�re Marie-Beno�t worked with Jewish co-conspirators to build remarkably effective Jewish-Christian rescue networks. Acting independently without Vatican support but with help from some priests, nuns, and local citizens, he and his friends persisted in their clandestine work until the Allies liberated Rome. After the conflict, P�re Marie-Beno�t maintained his wartime Jewish friendships and devoted the rest of his life to Jewish Christian reconciliation. Papal officials viewed both activities unfavorably until after the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II), 1962-1965.</p><p>To tell this remarkable tale, in addition to her research in French and Italian archives, Zuccotti personally interviewed P�re Marie-Beno�t, his family, Jewish rescuers with whom he worked, and survivors who owed their lives to his network.</p></p><p>2014 ForeWord Magazine Book of the Year Award, Gold Winner, History<p>Susan Zuccotti is author of The Italians and the Holocaust: Persecution, Rescue, and Survival; The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews; Under His Very Windows: The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy; and Holocaust Odysseys: The Jews of Saint-Martin-V�subie and Their Flight through France and Italy.

You get to the section where a favorite author's books reside, and there, nestled in comfortably between the incredibly familiar spines, sits a red notebook.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>What do you do?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The choice, I think, is obvious:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>You take down the red notebook and open it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>And then you do whatever it tells you to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>It was Christmastime in New York City, the most detestable time of the year. The moo-like crowds, the endless visits from hapless relatives, the ersatz cheer, the joyless attempts at joyfulness--my natural aversion to human contact could only intensify in this context. Wherever I went, I was on the wrong end of the stampede. I was not willing to grant "salvation" through any "army." I would never care about the whiteness of Christmas. I was a Decemberist, a Bolshevik, a career criminal, a philatelist trapped by unknowable anguish--whatever everyone else was not, I was willing to be. I walked as invisibly as I could through the Pavlovian spend-drunk hordes, the broken winter breakers, the foreigners who had flown halfway across the world to see the lighting of a tree without realizing how completely pagan such a ritual was.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The only bright side of this dim season was that school was shuttered (presumably so everyone could shop ad nauseam and discover that family, like arsenic, works best in small doses . . . unless you prefer to die). This year I had managed to become a voluntary orphan for Christmas, telling my mother that I was spending it with my father, and my father that I was spending it with my mother, so that each of them booked nonrefundable vacations with their post-divorce paramours. My parents hadn't spoken to each other in eight years, which gave me a lot of leeway in the determination of factual accuracy, and therefore a lot of time to myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I was popping back and forth between their apartments while they were away--but mostly I was spending time in the Strand, that bastion of titillating erudition, not so much a bookstore as the collision of a hundred different bookstores, with literary wreckage strewn over eighteen miles of shelves. All the clerks there saunter-slouch around distractedly in their skinny jeans and their thrift-store button-downs, like older siblings who will never, ever be bothered to talk to you or care about you or even acknowledge your existence if their friends are around . . . which they always are. Some bookstores want you to believe they're a community center, like they need to host a cookie-making class in order to sell you some Proust. But the Strand leaves you completely on your own, caught between the warring forces of organization and idiosyncrasy, with idiosyncrasy winning every time. In other words, it was my kind of graveyard.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I was usually in the mood to look for nothing in particular when I went to the Strand. Some days I would decide that the afternoon was sponsored by a particular letter, and would visit each and every section to check out the authors whose last names began with that letter. Other days, I would decide to tackle a single section, or would investigate the recently unloaded tomes, thrown in bins that never really conformed to alphabetization. Or maybe I'd only look at books with green covers, because it had been too long since I'd read a book with a green cover.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I could have been hanging out with my friends, but most of them were hanging out with their families or their Wiis. (Wiis? Wiii? What is the plural?) I preferred to hang out with the dead, dying, or desperate books--used we call them, in a way that we'd never call a person, unless we meant it cruelly. ("Look at Clarissa . . . she's such a used girl.")&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I was horribly bookish, to the point of coming right out and saying it, which I knew was not socially acceptable. I particularly loved the adjective bookish, which I found other people used about as often as ramrod or chum or teetotaler.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>On this particular day, I decided to check out a few of my favorite authors, to see if any irregular editions had emerged from a newly deceased person's library sale. I was perusing a particular favorite (he shall remain nameless, because I might turn against him someday) when I saw a peek of red. It was a red Moleskine--made of neither mole nor skin, but nonetheless the preferred journal of my associates who felt the need to journal in non-electronic form. You can tell a lot about a person from the page she or she chooses to journal on--I was strictly a college-ruled man myself, having no talent for illustration and a microscopic scrawl that made wide-ruled seem roomy. The blank pages were usually the most popular--I only had one friend, Thibaud, who went for the grid. Or at least he did until the guidance counselors confiscated his journals to prove that he had been plotting to kill our history teacher. (This is a true story.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>There wasn't any writing on the spine of this particular journal--I had to take it off the shelf to see the front, where there was a piece of masking tape with the words DO YOU DARE? written in black Sharpie. When I opened the covers, I found a note on the first page.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>I've left some clues for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>If you want them, turn the page.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>If you don't, put the book back on the shelf, please.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The handwriting was a girl's.

Pickett, C.S.A</h2><p>Profiles the Confederate general who led the suicidal charge at Gettysburg.</p><p>This first modern biography of the man who led the final Confederate attack at Gettysburg depicts neither an archetypical cavalier nor a shallow incompetent. Though Pickett's promotion owed something to the patronage of his superior Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, he had an excellent record of brigade command and did as well on July 3, 1863, as anyone was likely to have done in the circumstances. Nevertheless, Pickett lost the confidence of Robert E. Lee and spent most of the rest of the war on peripheral assignments in North Carolina and southern Virginia. Performing adequately under direct supervision, Pickett showed no aptitude for independent command despite some successes, notably in organizing the defenses of Petersburg in 1864. Longacre's sympathy for his subject leads him both to overestimate Pickett's military capacities and to understate Gettysburg's impact on a man who in its aftermath arguably suffered from what is now called post-traumatic stress disorder. This work is still a useful addition to the literature on Confederate command in the Civil War. Illustrations. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.The name of General George Pickett is readily recognizable owing to his role in the Battle of Gettysburg, yet this is the first biography of him since 1899. Longacre (Mounted Raids of the Civil War, Univ. of Nebraska., 1994) has written an excellent account of a gallant leader who risked his life in earlier battles but did not accompany his troops into the battle that still bears his name. Longacre depicts in a well-rounded manner Pickett's life and actions, from his days at West Point through the Mexican War, and details his leadership in the Civil War. The author also draws on Pickett's personal life to show how it affected his military life. Overall, Longacre's well-written study refutes most of the earlier accounts written about Pickett, yet gives a clear picture of his life and military exploits. Recommended for all libraries.<br><i>W.

Homer&#x2019;s story is thrilling, and his Greek is perhaps the most beautiful poetry ever sung or written. But until now, even the best English translations haven&#x2019;t been able to re-create the energy and simplicity, the speed, grace, and pulsing rhythm of the original. <br><br>In Stephen Mitchell&#x2019;s <i>Iliad, </i>the epic story resounds again across 2,700 years, as if the lifeblood of its heroes Achilles and Patroclus, Hector and Priam flows in every word. And we are there with them, amid the horror and ecstasy of war, carried along by a poetry that lifts even the most devastating human events into the realm of the beautiful. <br><br>Mitchell&#x2019;s <i>Iliad </i>is the first translation based on the work of the preeminent Homeric scholar Martin L. West, whose edition of the original Greek identifies many passages that were added after the <i>Iliad </i>was first written down, to the detriment of the music and the story. Omitting these hundreds of interpolated lines restores a dramatically sharper, leaner text. In addition, Mitchell&#x2019;s illuminating introduction opens the epic still further to our understanding and appreciation. <br><br>Now, thanks to Stephen Mitchell&#x2019;s scholarship and the power of his language, the <i>Iliad</i>&#x2019;s ancient story comes to moving, vivid new life.</p><p><p><b> A Look Inside: <em>The Iliad</em> [Click Images to Enlarge]</b></p> <i>First Seven Lines of the Iliad</i>: This reconstruction is based on what we know about the earliest Greek orthography. <p> </p> <i>The Walls of Troy</i>: The translator standing before the walls of the sixth city at Troy. <p> </p> <i>The Judgment of Paris</i>: On the right a youthful Paris sits on a stone in a rural location.

Learn more about their exciting and inspiring lives in Barbour's "Heroes of the Faith" series.<p>Here is the story of one man's remarkable conversion to Christianity and his fascinating life as a writer and scholar.</p>Grade 9 Up-Chelsea is off to a poor start in this series if it believes that fictionalized ramblings can substitute for accurate, well-documented biographies. Is the fact that these books examine "Heroes of the Faith" reason to hold them to lower standards? There are no illustrations and the indexes are woefully inadequate. C. S. Lewis lacks a bibliography of works by and about that author. Wellman also fails to discuss the continuing importance and influence of either man. These flaws, however, pale in comparison to the convoluted writing that's full of phony, invented dialogue-and, in Bunyan, completely fabricated scenes. Few readers will plod through these tedious, unreliable pages. Beatrice Gormley's C. S. Lewis (Eerdmans, 1997) is a far superior and more attractive production.<br><i>Ann W.

Dams continues her successful venture into writing mysteries featuring protagonist Dorothy Martin with <i>Malice in Miniature</i>. Dorothy, an American matron, has remarried and resettled in the fictional cathedral town of Sherebury. In the midst of toast and tea on a November afternoon, Dorothy and her husband, Alan, are startled by the arrival of Dorothy's friend Ada Finch, who is in a state of panic. Ada's son (Dorothy's gardener) has been arrested for stealing, and while Bob may have a soft spot for liquor, he is no thief--particularly when the article concerned is a 17th-century tea set created for a doll's house.<p> Dorothy agrees to help clear Bob's name, but she soon realizes that something more is afoot at Brockelsby Hall and its Museum of Miniatures than a mistake over a tea set. A few well-placed questions and Dorothy's growing interest in the dolls' houses and furnishings contained in the Victorian pile has her on the spot when the Danvers-esque housekeeper is poisoned. Bob is once again a suspect, but Dorothy is determined to find the real culprit. While Dams's prose is confident and polished, Dorothy as a nosy American sorting out British justice can be a bit grating. But the novel is amusing--our heroine's hat collection is a treat--and a proper follow-up to the author's previous Dorothy Martin novels: <i>The Body in the Transept</i>, <i>Trouble in the Town Hall</i>, and <i>Holy Terror in the Hebrides</i>. <i>--K.A.

But the Articles of Confederation, our first government, was a disaster. This crisis caused a group of men to journey to Philadelphia in 1787 to create a lasting and more stable government. <br> The lawyers and politicians, some famous and others just ordinary men, had no great expectations for the document they were fashioning. Somehow, in the amalgam of ideas, argument, and compromise, a great thing happened: A constitution and a form of government were created that have served us well. Carol Berkin tells the story of that amazing summer in Philadelphia, and makes you feel as if you were there, listening to the arguments, getting to know the framers, and appreciating the difficult and critical decisions being made.<br> Retelling a story that is more hallowed than understood, Berkin brings us into the world of eighteenth-century America and shows us the human side of a great accomplishment.<br></p><p>"The majority of historians seem to suggest that the founders knew just what to do--and did it, creating a government that would endure for centuries," writes CUNY historian Carol Berkin in the introduction to <i>A Brilliant Solution</i>. Sitting atop the pedestals we've placed them on, these figures would be "amused" by such notions, she says, because in reality the Constitutional Convention was gripped by "a near-paranoid fear of conspiracies" and might easily have succumbed to "a collective anxiety" over its daunting task. The story of the birth of the U.S. Constitution has been told many times, perhaps best by Catherine Drinker Bowen in <i>Miracle at Philadelphia</i>. Berkin's rendition of these well-known events is clear and concise. It does a bit more telling than showing, but this seems to be in the service of brevity--the main text is only about 200 pages. (Another 100 pages of useful appendices follow, including the full texts of the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution, plus short biographies of all the convention delegates.) Berkin is an opinionated narrator, unafraid, for instance, to call Maryland's Luther Martin "determinedly uncouth." She also points out that American government has evolved in ways that would make the founders cringe: they believed the presidency would be a ceremonial office (rather than the locus of the nation's political power) and that political parties were bad (when, in fact, they have served democracy well). Readers who want a sure-footed introduction to America's founding would do well to start here. <i>--John J. Miller</i>"Carol Berkin has now written the liveliest and most concise account yet of the adoption of the Constitution. With unflagging verve, she sweeps readers along as she introduces the players, canvasses the issues, and explains the critical decisions. And she manages the neat and difficult trick of presenting the framers of the Constitution as living, breathing, calculating politicians while simultaneously capturing the deep seriousness of their debates and achievements. The result is a sparkling, fast-paced, and always engaging introduction to the modern world's first great exercise in constitutional invention."-- Jack N. Rakove, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>James Madison and the Creation of the American Republic</i><br><br>"A story all modern Americans need to know--the exciting and true tale of our nation's origins, as narrated by one of our best historians."--Professor Mary Beth Norton, Cornell University <br> <br></p><h2>Discovering Wild Plants: Alaska, Western Canada, The Northwest</h2><p>Learn all about the interesting and delicious wild harvest of Alaska, western Canada, and the Northwest in this significant illustrated volume on 147 wild plants.</p><p></p><h2>The Blue Bistro: A Novel</h2><p><p>Elin Hilderbrand, author of the enchanting <i>Summer People</i> and <i>The Beach Club</i>, invites you to experience the perfect getaway with her sparkling new novel.</p><p>Adrienne Dealey has spent the past six years working for hotels in exotic resort towns.

Momoko is ultra-sensitive and feminine, picturing herself as a pampered French princess while meticulously embroidering frilly clothes. Ichigo is a member of a girls' biker gang who hides softer emotions and dresses like a feisty boy. When the two young people are thrown together, each helps the other develop new skills for survival&#x2014;and for living as a whole woman. Artist Kanesada continues Takemoto's story by writing and drawing an additional episode in Ichigo's maturation, then concludes with a tale about a schoolgirl who falls in love with an older man in the garment industry. The book is more character-driven than much manga, and the page layouts do an unusually good job of weaving together different levels of the action, as readers can simultaneously see what the characters are doing, saying and thinking. There's something creepy about young girls calling themselves "Lolitas" and imagining that having sex with a grownup will transform them into grownups, too. Still, there's also a genuine sweetness about these stories as the characters grope uncertainly with new roles and take chances that can pay off wonderfully. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In alternating viewpoints and voices, we hear from Rosa, a Cuban healer; Lieutenant Death, a slave hunter who chases her; and Weyler, a ruthless Spanish army officer. Written in free verse, the novel presents a challenge to the narrators, who have to respect both the form of the poetry and the flow of the story. Unfortunately, Yesenia Cabrero, who presents Rosa&#39;s parts (which make up the bulk of the audiobook), reads too slowly, often with the wrong emphasis, pausing because she comes to the end of a line, regardless of whether it&#39;s the end of a thought or a sentence. The four other narrators read more naturally, which makes Rosa&#39;s sections distract even more.

Whether you&#x2019;re writing to sell, shock, or just sing, <b>Sin and Syntax </b>is the guide you need to improve your command of the English language.</p><p>You gotta love a grammar guide that calls verbs "moody little suckers" and adverbs "promiscuous." Constance Hale (<i>Wired Style</i>) relishes prose that is deliberate, beautiful, and bold. Go ahead and break the rules, she says; just know the rules first, and know why you are breaking them. In <i>Sin &amp; Syntax</i>, Hale examines the elements of grammar from four angles: the "bones" (the grammar lesson), the "flesh" (the writing lesson), "cardinal sins" (what she calls "true transgressions"), and "carnal pleasures" (the beauty that results from either "hew[ing] exquisitely to the underlying codes of language," or not).<p> For illustration, Hale hails Walt Whitman and Roger Angell, and rails upon Alexander Haig and the Gump's catalogue. She hauls in Joan Didion to make a case for writing in the first person, Mark Twain to promote the killing of adjectives, C.S. Lewis to advocate showing rather than telling, and Loudon Wainwright III to lament the abuse of the word <i>like</i>. But Hale has no problem making her own points. "Euphemisms," she says, "are for wimps." She dismisses a particularly heinous example of scholarly prose as "a bunch of big words thrown into an Osterizer." Even other grammarians don't escape her derision: "Get a grip," Hale says. "<i>Hopefully</i> as a sentence adverb is here to stay."

Wendell Berry just as easily steps into Kentucky&#39;s Red River Gorge and makes the observations of a poet as he does step away to view his subject with the keen, unflinching eye of an essayist. The inimitable voice of Wendell Berry-at once frank and lovely-is our guide as we explore this unique wilderness. Located in eastern Kentucky and home to 26,000 acres of untamed river, rock formations, historical sites, unusual vegetation and wildlife, the Gorge very nearly fell victim to a man-made lake thirty years ago. &#34;No place is to be learned like a textbook,&#34; Berry tells us, and so through revealing the Gorge&#39;s corners and crevices, its ridges and rapids, his words not only implore us to know more but to venture there ourselves. Infused with his very personal perspective and enhanced by the startling photographs of Ralph Eugene Meatyard, The Unforeseen Wilderness draws the reader in to celebrate an extraordinary natural beauty and to better understand what threatens it.</p><p></p><h2>The Farmhouse: (American Design)</h2><p>Looks at the interior designs of farmhouses in New England, the South, and the West</p><p>This lavishly illustrated, oversize volumeone of two (see review below) inaugural titles in Bantam's American Design seriesexamines "the roots of our vernacular architecture," demonstrating how preservation can foster reclamation of farmland, vineyards and orchards, as well as restoration of antiquated farmhouses and efficiency buildings (stables, silos, wineries, etc.).

Having lost his license to practice medicine, his morphine habit isn't as easy to support as it used to be. So he lives in a rented room in the red-light district on the south side of San Antonio, performing abortions and patching up the odd knife or gunshot wound. But when Graciela, a young Mexican immigrant, appears in the neighborhood in search of Doc's services, miraculous things begin to happen. Graciela sustains a wound on her wrist that never heals, yet she heals others with the touch of her hand.

Set in San Antonio around the time of JFK&#x2019;s assassination, and told with an equal mix of sympathy and violent detail, the story maintains a delicate balance of many such would-be opposing forces: Catholicism and "hoodoo," addiction and redemption, brutal reality and magical realism. A first novel this compelling from any author would be cause for celebration, but Earle is also a musician (the GRAMMY�-winning albums <em>Washington Square Serenade</em> and <em>Townes</em>), actor (<em>The Wire</em>), and activist, and in this context the book is even more of a watershed accomplishment. <em>I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive</em> is decidedly not for the faint of art, but adventuresome fiction readers will find much to love in its shocking, tender depths. --<em>Jason Kirk</em>HMH&nbsp;Hardcover 2011ISBN 978-0-618-82096-2</p><h2>The Silent Twins: A true story of love and hate, dreams and desolation, genius and destruction</h2><p>This is the astonishing tale of June and Jennifer Gibbons, identical twins whose silent, antisocial exterior hid a rich, vast, creative life.

Anaxandra has adjusted to her new life when, six years later, Siphnos is sacked by pirates, and she is the sole survivor.

As a child she is taken as a hostage to the island of King Nicander. When she is 13, marauding pirates sack the palace, killing everyone but her. Anaxander frightens them off by pretending to be the goddess Medusa, with the help of an octopus as a hairdo. When she is rescued by the ships of King Menalaus, she assumes the identity of a princess, Nicander's daughter, and becomes a royal guest. When Menalaus's cold and vain wife, Helen, runs off to Troy with her lover, Paris, Anaxander goes along to protect Helen's baby son. Within the walls of Troy, she is torn with conflicting loyalties as the bronze-clad warriors of Menalaus land their ships on the plains below the city and war is imminent. <p> The characters of the Iliad come vividly alive in this action-filled novel: the shallow and amoral Paris, the wailing prophetess Cassandra in her tower prison, and especially Hector, a big, straight-talking sweetheart. Fans of Cooney's contemporary novels like <i>The Face on the Milk Carton</i> will find this story of ancient Greece every bit as irresistible.

He takes her back to Sparta with him where Helen, his beautiful wife, does not believe that the red-headed child is Princess Callisto. Although fearful of the half-mortal, half-goddess Helen, Anaxandra is able to stay out of harm?s way?until the Trojan princes Paris and Aeneas arrive. Paris and Helen?s fascination with each other soon turns to passion and plunges Sparta and Troy into war. Can Anaxandra find the courage to reinvent herself once again, appease the gods, and save herself? <br><br>In Caroline B.

Settled by nine African American clans during the 1940s, the town represents a small miracle of self-reliance and community spirit. Readers might be forgiven, in fact, for assuming that Morrison's title refers to Ruby itself, which even during the 1970s retains an atmosphere of neighborliness and small-town virtue. Yet Paradises are not so easily gained. As we soon discover, Ruby is fissured by ancestral feuds and financial squabbles, not to mention the political ferment of the era, which has managed to pierce the town's pious isolation. In the view of its leading citizens, these troubles call for a scapegoat. And one readily exists: the Convent, an abandoned mansion not far from town--or, more precisely, the four women who occupy it, and whose unattached and unconventional status makes them the perfect targets for patriarchal ire. ("Before those heifers came to town," the men complain, "this was a peaceable kingdom.") One July morning, then, an armed posse sets out from Ruby for a round of ethical cleansing. <p> <i>Paradise</i> actually begins with the arrival of these vigilantes, only to launch into an intricate series of flashbacks and interlaced stories. The cast is large--indeed, it seems as though we must have met all 360 members of Ruby's populace--and Morrison knows how to imprint even the minor players on our brains. Even more amazing, though, are the full-length portraits she draws of the four Convent dwellers and their executioners: rich, rounded, and almost painful in their intimacy. This richness--of language and, ultimately, of human understanding--combats the aura of saintliness that can occasionally mar Morrison's fiction. It also makes for a spectacular piece of storytelling, in which such biblical concepts as redemption and divine love are no postmodern playthings but matters of life and (in the very first sentence, alas) death.</p>Praise for Toni Morrison reading <b>Sula</b><p>"Toni Morrison's speaking voice contains the same musicality as her prose, and the combination of the two results in a nearly sublime experience." <br>- The Chicago Tribune</p><p>". . . it's a storyteller's voice - older than sound recording, older even than print itself." <br>-The Trenton Times</p><p>"Morrison's remarkable talent for storytelling naturally lends itself to the spoken word."<br> - The Arizona Republic</p></p><h2>The Noble Qur&#39;an: The English Translation of the Meanings and Commentary</h2><p>Bound in blue heavily gilt decorated cloth, with silk bookmark</p><p></p><h2>Three Years in a Twelve-Foot Boat</h2><p>This is the true narrative of a middle-aged poet who rows and sails a featherweight wooden boat through nineteen countries - 15,000 miles - to relive his youth and savor adventure.

Ladd was born in Bremerton, Washington in 1953. As a child he was happy to sit in a corner reading books of history or geography. After high school he traveled through Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America, passing a traumatic month in a Moroccan prison. He navigated the emotional crisis of his youth alone, in foreign cultures. Upon his return, Steve studied urban planning, obtaining degrees from Western Washington and Harvard Universities. From 1976 to 1990 he worked for various cities, writing land use plans and environmental regulations. He also advanced his poetry and music, and forestalled his wanderlust by wilderness skiing. 1987 found Steve still single, hardy, and non-materialistic, so he spent three years designing and building the 12-foot Squeak; and three more years sailing her through nineteen countries. Steve returned home in 1993. He finished his manuscript and once again plans for cities. Meanwhile his wanderlust slowly wells anew.</p><h2>The Cyclist Who Went Out in the Cold: Adventures Riding the Iron Curtain</h2><p><p><strong>Tim Moore and a rickety metal steed are back together&#x2015;riding the entirety of the Iron Curtain, where history, mechanical failures, physical endurance, and humor come together for "the Bill Bryson on two wheels."</strong></p> Not content with tackling the Italian Alps or the route of the Tour de France, Tim Moore sets out to scale a new peak of rash over-ambition: 6,000 mile route of the old Iron Curtain on a tiny-wheeled, two-geared East German shopping bike. <p>Asking for trouble and getting it, Moore sets off from the northernmost Norwegian-Russian border at the Arctic winter&#x2019;s brutal height, bullying his plucky MIFA 900 through the endless sub-zero desolation of snowbound Finland.

Marlowe is the quintessential American detective: cynical yet idealistic; romantic yet full of despair; a gentleman capable of rough violence. </p> <p> The stories are written by some of the detective-mystery genre's leading lights, including Max Allan Collins, Sara Paretsky, Roger L. Simon, Stuart M. Kaminsky, Robert Crais, Edward Hoch, Ed Gorman, Eric Van Lustbader, Loren Estleman, Simon Brett, and Joyce Harrington. The final story in the volume is Raymond Chandler's last Marlowe adventure:"The Pencil." </p> <p> The stories run chronologically through the career of Marlowe, from 1935 through 1960. These are classic Marlowe tales of betrayal, mistrust, and double-dealing on the seamy side of Los Angeles.</p></p><p><b>Penzler Pick, January 2000</b>: Originally published a decade ago and now expanded, this book is a homage to the greatest detective story writer of the 20th century, an Anglo-American who took Los Angeles, his adopted home, off the road maps and into the land of legend. For Raymond Chandler, who died in 1959, his literary descendants will do just about anything, and that includes contributing to an anthology honoring him. Thus, in here we find the likes of Sara Paretsky, Robert Crais, Loren D. Estleman, Jonathan Valin, Robert Campbell, Eric Van Lustbader, Simon Brett, Julie Smith, Jeremiah Healy, Roger L. Simon, James Grady, and numerous others creating stories in the style of Chandler and in the voice of Marlowe. But, as editor Byron Preiss remarks, "The contributors of this book are here to honor Chandler, not to steal from him."<p> He also says, "Many would not be the writers they are had not Chandler followed Hammett and Cain down the back alley of fiction into the realm of art." That's certainly a succinctly expressive summation. Moreover, today the idea of the "mean streets" that Chandler wished the best heroes to traverse is one that has, perhaps more than ever before, seized the imagination of the public when it comes to popular entertainment. What's old is new again, as they say, and in this case that means <i>noir</i>.</p><p> In an introduction by Robert B. Parker--who himself finished the incomplete Chandler novel <i>Poodle Springs</i> (1990)--we learn the essentials of Chandler's life (the British public school education, the wife who was 18 years older than he, etc.). But in the stories essayed here we get the effects of an imagined world that has become an entire universe.</p><p> Among the many included are tales of the Thelma Todd murder scandal by Max Allan Collins; of Dr. Seuss's missing watercolors by Robert L. Simon; of a pro wrestler called The Crusher by Jonathan Valin; and of the ancient jeweled skull that was the inspiration for Hammett's <i>Maltese Falcon</i> by Dick Lochte.</p><p> Two new stories, not in the earlier edition of this volume, are by Simon, creator of Moses Wine, and J. Madison Davis, the author of <i>Red Knight</i> and <i>White Rook</i> and president of the North American Association of International Crime Writers.</p><p> Finally, there is an afterword by Chandler scholar and biographer Frank McShane. And, yes, the real Raymond Chandler is here too, represented by the story "The Pencil," in which that particular writing instrument turns out to be one gift you never want to receive. This book is not quite the real thing; it can't be. But it's as close as you could hope to find. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Philip Marlowe is arguably the most popular and influential character in American hard-boiled detective fiction. There is a little bit of the wise-cracking, incorruptible Marlowe in just about every detective that followed since he made his debut in Chandler's The Big Sleep in 1939. To commemorate Chandler's 1988 centenary, 25 of today's top mystery writers, e.g., Max Allan Collins, Sara Paretsky, and Loren Estleman, offer their take on Marlowe. The collection is nicely capped with Chandler's own last Marlowe story, "The Pencil." Marlowe's popularity has waned very little, so this should circulate well. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Modern Classics: Knit Over Twenty Timeless Designs</h2><p>Take a timeless approach to knitting with 20 classic styles that spotlight a distinctly modern twist. <p>� More than 20 pullovers, jackets, and cardigans feature easy coloring, textured stitching, and trouble-free details </p><p>� Try three different yarn weights; then get a perfect fit with expert sizing secrets </p><p>� Simply alter details for an endless variety of unique looks</p></p><p>Louisa Harding designed for Rowan Yarns for 10 years.

Please find out if Sarah and Simon and No Red Paint is still in print, she implored, and if it is not, please do all you can to publish it. With some difficulty we procured the book, which was indeed out of print, read it, and fell in love.<br><br> Here is the story of two children, Sarah and Simon, whose father is a painter, and who live with their parents and baby brother in a big room called a Studio. Their father is talented, but unacknowledged, and so the family is poor, though very happy. When the story opens, the father is painting his masterpiece. Sarah and Simon are good little helpers and spend their time doing chores and visiting their favorite place in town: the old second-hand bookshop with its kind owner. Soon the masterpiece is almost finished, except for the bit of red paint needed to complete it, and even the dealer agrees to buy it if it were finished the next day. But there is no more red paint, and no more money left with which to buy it. So Sarah and Simon set out to help their father, and to their surprise, end up reconciling their family with an estranged uncle and restoring the family fortune as well all with the help and kind solicitation of the bookshop owner...<br><br> Godine is proud to bring this classic with its detailed line drawings and delicate watercolor illustrations back into print, and our thanks to the good bookshop buyer who came to the rescue of this wonderful book.</p><p>Edward Ardizzone, born in 1900 in French Indochina, became a war artist during World War II. He illustrated more than twenty children&#39;s books including classics by Dickens, Mark Twain, Dylan Thomas and Christianna Brand&#39;s Nurse Matilda series.The cross-hatched ink and sepia-washed drawings in Edward Ardizzone&#39;s newly republished &#34;Sarah and Simon and No Red Paint&#34; (Godine, 48 pages, $17.95) evoke another lost era, that of Britain in the early 1960s. In a pleasantly old-fashioned story that begins with struggle and ends with redemption, we meet two children who live with their mother, their baby brother, and their father, a painter, &#34;in a great big room called a Studio.&#34; Though loving, the family is poor, for it seems that when the painter refused to renounce art and embrace business, his rich Uncle Robert had cut him off without a farthing. Willingly, Sarah and Simon help their parents make do: They wash their father&#39;s brushes, sit for portraits, run errands. Their favorite refuge is a shabby second-hand bookshop, whose owner lets them read all they like in exchange for doing a bit of dusting. So when their father runs out of red paint--and money--just as he is completing his masterpiece, it is to the bookshop that the children run. And it is there, after overhearing their anguished conversation, that a crusty old customer decides that he will reveal himself not only as an artistic well-wisher but also as . . . Ah, but that would be telling. --Wall Street Journal</p><h2>Furies: War in Europe, 1450&#x2013;1700</h2><p><p>We think of the Renaissance as a shining era of human achievementa pinnacle of artistic genius and humanist brilliance, the time of Shakespeare, Michelangelo, and Montaigne. Yet it was also an age of constant, harrowing warfare. Armies, not philosophers, shaped the face of Europe as modern nation-states emerged from feudal society. In <i>Furies</i>, one of the leading scholars of Renaissance history captures the dark reality of the period in a gripping narrative mosaic. </p><p>As Lauro Martines shows us, total war was no twentieth-century innovation. These conflicts spared no civilians in their path. A Renaissance army was a mobile city-indeed, a force of 20,000 or 40,000 men was larger than many cities of the day. And it was a monster, devouring food and supplies for miles around. It menaced towns and the countryside-and itself-with famine and disease, often more lethal than combat. Fighting itself was savage, its violence increased by the use of newly invented weapons, from muskets to mortars. </p><p>For centuries, notes Martines, the history of this period has favored diplomacy, high politics, and military tactics. <i>Furies</i> puts us on the front lines of battle, and on the streets of cities under siege, to reveal what Europes wars meant to the men and women who endured them.</p></p><p><b>Lauro Martines</b> is one of the worlds foremost historian's of the Italian Renaissance and early modern Europe. He is the author of nine books, most recently the critically acclaimed titles <i>Fire in the City: Savonarola and the Struggle for the Soul of Renaissance Florence</i> and <i>April Blood: Florence and the Plot Against the Medici</i>. Born in Chicago, he was a professor of history at UCLA. He now lives in London with his wife, the novelist Julia OFaolain.Unlucky were civilians of early modern Europe in the path of an army on the march or in a city under siege. No safer were soldiers, more apt to die from disease and starvation than battle. Vignettes of horror from the era&#x2019;s maelstroms, grandly titled the Thirty Years&#x2019; War or the Dutch Revolt, abound in Martines&#x2019; treatment, which tries to raise ethical questions about panoramas of war. Discounting princes&#x2019; justifications for war, which come across as aristocratic brigandage in his text, Martines sets aside conventional military history of campaigns and leaders to show the hand of Mars on the peasants and villagers it touched. It coerced them into armies, but Mars&#x2019; royal sponsors failed to render promised pay and supplies. To square accounts, their generals instead let soldiers pillage the countryside and sack cities, examples Martines draws from eyewitnesses to plunder, arson, and killing. Ending by asking historians&#x2014;he is a specialist on Renaissance Florence&#x2014;to consider morality in their political and military works about the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Martines poises an agenda atop graphic historical envisioning of what he decries. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>Julia Morgan Built a Castle</h2><p>From the time she was little, Julia Morgan wanted to know how everything fit together. Her family often visited San Francisco, where she could puzzle over the many new buildings under construction there. Julia desperately wanted to be an architect&#x2014;but in the late nineteenth century that was rare for a woman.<p> Julia was not deterred. After several rejections, she finally made it into the prestigious all-male �cole des Beaux Arts, in Paris. She also became California's first licensed female architect and designed over 800 buildings, including newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst's magnificent San Simeon. With exquisite illustrations, this is the story of a spirited pioneer.</p></p><p>Celeste Davidson Mannis lives in Los Angeles, California.<p> Miles Hyman attended the �cole des Beaux Arts&#x2014;just like Julia Morgan&#x2014;and lives in Paris, France, and California.</p>Grade 1-5&#x2013;This picture book is a wonderful way to introduce young readers to a groundbreaking female architect. Luminescent illustrations, created using soft pastels and pencils in a golden-peach palette, appear to glow with the light of California and France, both seminal locations in Morgan's life. Informed by architecture, the paintings evoke C�zanne's attention to form: the folds of dresses, the curve of a mountain, a shadow over a hat. The opening spread shows a youngster constructing a geometric sandcastle while the text quietly states: Julia Morgan loved to build. The book highlights other significant moments: young Julia visiting construction sites with her engineer father; being the only woman in her engineering class at UC Berkeley in the 1890s; her pride at receiving a certificate in architecture from Paris's �cole des Beaux-Arts; her return to San Francisco and early career. The last half of the book is devoted to the construction of William Randolph Hearst's San Simeon. Mannis points out that Morgan's creations are solidly built and noted for their enduring beauty. Filled with rich vocabulary, the narrative employs scrumptious architectural terms such as Baroque, flying buttresses, and teakwood cornice. An inspiring tale and encouragement for someday builders.<i>&#x2013;Teresa Pfeifer, Alfred Zanetti Montessori Magnet School, Springfield, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Includes high-quality b&amp;w photos. For general readers. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>With a haunting cinematic quality, <i>Heaven and Earth</i> is a documentary record in prose and photographs of farming families on the North Fork of Long Island, New York. The book traces the Sisyphean efforts of the people who have inhabited these farms, weaving together three centuries of family history with portrayals of present-day farm life, land acquisition and sales, labor and machinery, and the unstoppable encroachment of suburbs. The weather and changes in the seasons shape the later chapters of the book, adding even greater uncertainty to an already difficult enterprise. The varied people who work the land speak from the pages of this book and the farms of Long Island become moving testimonies to the power of human perseverance.Wick's (Bad Company: Drugs, Hollywood, and the Cotton Club Murder, 1990) elegiac story of the farmers on the North Fork of New York's Long Island, whose centuries-old way of life is approaching a sorry finale. The last glaciers bequeathed to the North Fork a rich, loamy earth, free of boulders, a bounty not lost on the native Algonquins, who farmed the land for many a year. When Europeans came ashore in 1640, they too appreciated the agricultural potential of the land, much of it cleared into meadows thoughtfully provided by the Algonquins before they were given trinkets, rum, and dubious legal documents and told to take a hike. Descendants of those first European settlers--the Wickhams, Tuthills, and Wellses- -continue to farm the North Fork 350 years later, for potatoes and peaches and cherries, apples, tomatoes, corn, and hay, a mere two hours and a lightyear away from New York City. Wick, a Pulitzer Prizewinning reporter for Newsday who lives in the area, did his homework: His narrative starts way before the first European contact, and continues with the 15th-century English cod fishermen fetching these reaches, Cabot and Verrazano and Hudson, the Pequot wars. He follows closely, very closely, the lives of the earliest settlers, how they shaped the land, finagled every last acre from the natives, conducted their internecine rivalries, handled the influx of Irish in the 1840s and Poles in the years after 1910. Threaded into this history are the lives of the Wickham and Tuttle families, what it means to be one of them today: contending with taxes and pesticide restrictions and farmhand camp inspectors, struggling with failing machinery, failing prices, failing weather, and vineyards and condos the crops of the future. (Sixty-four pages of photos by Lynn Johnson were not available for review.) Storm warnings cloud the North Fork farming forecast, much as they did for Peter Matthiessen's fishers in Men's Lives. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She may be intimate with the disorientation of the expatriate, but she does not restrict herself to a literal definition of border-crossing. As the characters in her exuberant, uneven first novel in English make clear, feeling like an alien has little to do with visa status.<p>A shabby, rambling house in a Boston suburb is home to three graduate students in three different fields from three different continents with three different religious orientations. They share -- well, not much, actually, but somehow each has found a home with the other two. Abed is a Moroccan biochemist, a Muslim teetotaler fond of argument and haunted by a jinn that stalks his nightmares. Piyu, a devout Catholic from Spain, is at dental school despite his morbid fear of sharp objects. And Omer, newly arrived from Istanbul to study political science, denies all gods except three: alcohol, marijuana and coffee.</p><p>Opposite these foreign men are three American women who are, if anything, even less at home in the world. Alegre, Piyu's Chicana girlfriend, cooks copiously for the roommates as well as her own tribe of aunts while hiding her bulimia from all of them. Gail is a bipolar, suicidal, fiercely doctrinaire chocolate maker who unexpectedly and rather inexplicably marries Omer. Gail's jilted partner, Debra Ellen Thompson (never just Debra, please), rescued Gail from paralyzed anonymity at Mt. Holyoke, fell in love with her, and is now in powerless thrall to the woman she once empowered.</p><p>With characters this extravagantly eccentric, there isn't much room for plot. What we get instead is a series of wacky, occasionally brilliant, infuriatingly overstuffed soliloquies, as the perspective shifts from one character to the next. These are interspersed with group scenes in which two or more players offer their opinions -- often at high volume -- without actually offending anyone. Defiantly unstereotypical though they may be, the characters are still rigidly consistent in their contrasts. Having endowed her creations with so many quirks and hidden wounds, Shafak stops short of giving them life.</p><p>The true center of Shafak's novel is language itself. Words fill every inch of the frame, cavorting, crowding, parading, nesting within each other and leering from corners like the teeming figures in a Bosch painting -- words that can unlock the secrets of a culture or, just as easily, obscure them further. In Shafak's hands, the words are often more tangible than the ideas they are trying to transmit. Omer is "in every single layer down to the lowest echelons of his soul, demoralized and unsettled, poo-scared and exhausted into slow motion by the hyperspeed of that crepuscular hologram called 'time.' " Shafak delights in clever parallelisms: Describing the solidarity of expats, she notes that "they detached from their own flocks to migrate to faraway lands, and once there, they flocked into detachments." Acutely aware that language is the key to their happiness in America, the roommates invent a game to enlarge their vocabularies; their resulting sesquipedalianism -- "a long word to define the lust for long words" -- seems to have affected their creator as well.</p><p>Shafak loads her narrative with an exhaustive multiplicity of detail, a refusal (or an inability) to filter details that echoes the bewilderment of the stranger in a strange land. Thus, at the moment that Omer opens his eyes on his first morning in his new home, "a UPS van loaded with letters and boxes, a hacker on his way to break into the computer of one of his professors who he heard had accused him of being a 'hacker,' a Norwegian tourist lost on his way to the Museum of Modern Art, and a pizza delivery boy who had just received two phone calls from people unknown to him . . . plowed through Pearl Street." Sometimes exhaustive is just exhausting.</p><p>But there are serendipitous gems to be found in Shafak's prose. She understands the ancient fear that loving a foreigner can provoke, the sense that "even if the couple managed to get along flawlessly, when they tumbled deep down into their own slumber each night, their gods would start fighting till dawn." She has a sharp eye for American absurdity, like the tendency to give florid names to shades of paint -- a puddle of Alegre's vomit, Shafak points out, matches the chip of pink called It's a Girl! Her message, shorn of linguistic flourishes, is simple and deeply humanist. Life in the borderless modern world can bring all but the strongest to the brink of incipient insanity. In the end, Shafak asks, "Who is the real stranger -- the one who lives in a foreign land and knows he belongs elsewhere or the one who lives the life of a foreigner in her native land and has no place else to belong?" </p><p>Reviewed by Janice P.

Now, five restaurants later, and working in collaboration with Zeidler ( The Gourmet Jewish Cook ) and journalist Weimer, he brings his love of food to the page. Richard may be classically trained, but he firmly believes in experimenting with taste and texture to develop something new: he borrows often from diverse cultures and cuisines to create the unexpected (e.g., cream cheese gnocchi with corn spinach). Some of these recipes hearken back to his northern French roots while others are California-influenced. But no matter what the inspiration, Richard has done a superb job of adapting restaurant recipes for the average kitchen. He makes it clear, nonetheless, that a recipe is just a guide, not a guarantee. Turning out a delectable meal is the responsibility of the cook. And there are no substitutes for good preparation or for an innate feel for food. Each recipe includes a brief introduction and excellent preparation and do-ahead suggestions. Some recipes sound deceptively simple, because they call for only a few ingredients, but to achieve the result Richard wants requires serious labor--and skill. (Mushroom tarts with garlic cream call for boiling and rinsing garlic three times.) His enthusiasm is so infectious, however, and his recipes are so well-written, that even the inexperienced may gear up to try chicken kataifi with purple sauce--it's too intriguing not to.

Best known for her work on the origins of eukaryotic cells, the Gaia hypothesis, and symbiogenesis as a driving force in evolution, her work has forever changed the way we understand life on Earth.</p> <p>When Margulis passed away in 2011, she left behind a groundbreaking scientific legacy that spanned decades. In this collection, Dorion Sagan, Margulis's son and longtime collaborator, gathers together the voices of friends and colleagues to remark on her life and legacy, in essays that cover her early collaboration with James Lovelock, her fearless face-off with Richard Dawkins during the so-called "Battle of Balliol" at Oxford, the intrepid application of her scientific mind to the insistence that 9/11 was a false-flag operation, her affinity for Emily Dickinson, and more.</p> <p>Margulis was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1983, received the prestigious National Medal of Science in 1999, and her papers are permanently archived at the Library of Congress. Less than a month before her untimely death, Margulis was named one of the twenty most influential scientists alive - one of only two women on this list, which include such scientists as Stephen Hawking, James Watson, and Jane Goodall.</p></p><p><p>Dorion Sagan is author of numerous articles and twenty-three books translated into eleven languages, including&nbsp;<em>Notes from the Holocene: A Brief History of the Future</em> and <em>Into the Cool</em>, coauthored with Eric D. Schneider. His writings have appeared in <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The</em> <em>New York Times Book Review, Wired</em>, The <em>Skeptical Inquirer, Pabular, Smithsonian,</em> <em>The Ecologist, Co-Evolution Quarterly</em>, <em>The</em> <em>Times Higher Education, Omni, Natural History, The Sciences, Cabinet, and Tricycle. </em>He edited <em>Lynn Margulis: The Life and Legacy of a Scientific Rebel</em>, a 2012 collection of writings addressing Margulis's life and work.</p><p><em><strong>ForeWord Reviews-</strong></em><br><br>Best known for her work on the origins of eukaryotic cells, symbiogenesis as a force in evolution, and the Gaia hypothesis, Lynn Margulis was a scientist whose lively spirit and frank opinions left behind an enduring legacy that&#x2019;s well worth remembering.&nbsp; When she died after a stroke in 2011, obituaries emphasized her ability to turn complicated scientific concepts into mainstream discussions, and even after she married famous cosmologist Carl Sagan, her own star was just as bright.&nbsp; In this thoughtful and expertly curated collection, Margulis&#x2019;s son and long-time collaborator, Dorion Sagan, calls her &#x201c;indomitable Lynn.&#x201d; A fearless and zealous advocate of her theories who could also display a loving heart, he writes, &#x201c;[H]er threat was not to people but to the evil done to the spirit by the entrenchment of unsupported views.&#x201d;&nbsp; In other essays, Margulis&#x2019;s complex personality beguiles, frustrates, charms, and elevates various writers, resulting in a stunning portrait that no single remembrance could have captured.</p><br><br><p>Luminaries throughout the scientific world share their memories of her bulldog attitude and scientific contributions, showing that although she&#x2019;s gone, her work definitely still resonates and informs evolutionary biology and other fields.&nbsp; Jorge Wagensberg, a physicist and professor from the University of Barcelona, calls Margulis &#x201c;biology&#x2019;s greatest heroine,&#x201d; while astrobiologist Penny Boston recalls the scientist&#x2019;s ability to be like an &#x201c;earth mother&#x201d; who was encouraging and friendly.&nbsp; Other contributors share stories about traipsing with her through marshes on Cape Cod talking about biology, or calling Margulis in the middle of the night with sudden scientific insight (only to have her gently say, &#x201c;Okay. Now go back to sleep&#x201d;). There are several of her students who recall her tenacity and ferocious curiosity, two attributes that drove them toward deepening their own research.&nbsp;</p><br><br><p>The collection is organized chronologically, grouping together essays about her early days as a scientist and following with her establishment in the scientific community, her work as a &#x201c;modern-day Copernicus,&#x201d; and her role as a teacher, neighbor, and friend. The photographs included in the volume are also perfectly chosen, with every image showing her forceful personality, relentless focus, and often-captivating smile.&nbsp; Taken as a whole, Sagan&#x2019;s collection is a fitting tribute to a woman whose life and legacy have touched so many others. As he notes, her indomitable spirit lives on through her children, grandchildren, colleagues, and students&#x2015;and most of all, through the work that she championed so well.<br></p><br><br><p><em><strong>Publishers Weekly-</strong></em><br><br>There are two kinds of great scientists, writes former American Society of Microbiology president Moselio Schaechter in this eclectic, sometimes electrifying, book about biologist Lynn Margulis. There are those making "impressive experiments" and those making "groundbreaking theoretical syntheses." Margulis was the latter, notes Schaechter. Margulis fiercely championed evolutionary symbiogenesis, the merging of distinct organisms to form new organisms in swift, un-Darwinian leaps. Margulis was eventually proven right in some life forms. But her insistence that most evolution involves symbiogenesis led to a lifetime of debate. It also leads to some inspired writing in this book of essays, edited by Sagan, her son and cowriter (<em>Dazzle Gradually: Reflections on the nature of Nature</em>). "A dangerous liaison" is what Margulis felt drove species creation, writes Oxford paleobiologist Martin Brasier in one of the best essays. "A symbiosis between two distantly related organisms that wantonly swapped their genetic information to form completely new genetic strains." Some writing here reflects the idea that life is not a hierarchical tree, but a web, and embraces aspects of the controversial "Gaia" earth model which may put [off] Traditional Darwinian scientists. But this is a captivating read for anyone interested in what powers great scientists.</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;I hope that in due time she will be recognized as one of the greatest scientific thinkers of our time.&#x201d;<strong>--Ernest Callenbach, author of <em>Ecotopia</em> </strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Although she could be a bulldog, her heart was soft and her spirit loving beneath the scientific realpolitik of her conversation and the insistent tough-mindedness of her sometimes strident and blunt, withering and refreshingly unadorned opinions.&#x201d;<strong>--Dorion Sagan, from the introduction</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the ideas that really matter&#x2015;and Lynn certainly had hers.

In this volume, we can read about some of the vast range of intellect she influenced."<strong>--Wes Jackson, president, The Land Institute</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Lynn and I often argued, as good collaborators should, and we wrangled over the intricate finer points of self-regulation, but always remained good friends, perhaps because we were confident that we were right.&#x201d;<strong>--Dr. James Lovelock, contributor, and author of <em>The Vanishing Face of Gaia</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;It was life&#x2015;profligate, teeming<em> life</em> in all its weirdness&#x2015;that held the magic for her, not this featherless biped with its confused aspirations. Lynn intuited and doggedly gathered evidence to show that most anything we two-leggeds take special pride in&#x2015;our capacities for cogitation, conviviality, and culture&#x2015;had been invented, eons before, by the microbial entities that compose us.&#x201d;<strong>--David Abram, contributor, and author of <em>Spell of the Sensuous</em></strong></p></p><h2>The Silent Gondoliers: A Fable by S.

Rahe challenges prevailing interpretations of ancient Greek republicanism, early modern political thought, and the founding of the American republic. '[An] extraordinary book. . . . It is a great achievement and will stay as a landmark.'--<i>The Spectator</i> (London) 'This is the first, comprehensive study of republicanism, ancient and modern, written for our time.'--Harvey Mansfield, Harvard University 'A stunning feat of scholarship, presented with uncommon grace and ease--the sort of big, important book that comes along a few times in a generation. In an age of narrow specialists, it ranges through the centuries from classical Greece to the new American Republic, unfolding a coherent new interpretation of the rise of modern republicanism. . . . World-class, and sure to have a quite extraordinary impact.'--Lance Banning, University of Kentucky Volume I: The Ancien Regime in Classical Greece Where social scientists and many ancient historians tend to follow Max Weber or Karl Marx in asserting the centrality of status or class, Rahe's depiction of the illiberal, martial republics of classical Hellas vindicates Aristotle's insistence on the determinative influence of the political regime and brings back to life a world in which virtue is pursued as an end, politics is given primacy, and socioeconomic concerns are subordinated to grand political ambition. Volume II: New Modes and Orders in Early Modern Political Thought Where many intellectual historians discern a revival of the classical spirit in the political speculation of the age stretching from Machiavelli to Adam Smith, Rahe brings to light a self-conscious repudiation of the theory and practice of ancient self-government and an inclination to restrict the scope of politics, to place greater reliance on institutions than on virtuous restraint, and to give free rein to the human's capacities as a tool-making animal. Volume III: Inventions of Prudence: Constituting the American Regime Where students of the American founding are inclined to dispute whether the Revolution was liberal, republican, or merely confused, Rahe demonstrates that the American regime embodies an uneasy, fragile, and carefully worked-out compromise between the enlightened despotism espoused by Thomas Hobbes and the classical republicanism defended by Pericles and Demosthenes.<br><br></p><p>"Rahe has written a seminal work that will for a long time put students of political thought in general, and of the ideas of the American founding in particular, in his debt. In a way that even evokes comparison with such masterworks of philosophy, history, and social science, as those of Aristotle, Niccolo Machiavelli, and Baron de Montesquieu, Rahe brings to our contemplation the complex fabric of republican political inquiry from Plato to Thomas Jefferson."--Ralph Ketcham, <i>William and Mary Quarterly</i> <br>Where many intellectual historians discern a revival of the classical spirit in the political speculation of the age stretching from Machiavelli to Adam Smith, Rahe brings to light a self-conscious repudiation of the theory and practice of ancient self-government and an inclination to restrict the scope of politics, to place greater reliance on institutions than on virtuous restraint, and to give free rein to the human&#39;s capacities as a toolmaking animal.</p><h2>You Can Never Find a Rickshaw When It Monsoons - The World on One Cartoon a Day</h2><p>A collection of the author&#39;s sketches, done during a yearlong trip around the world soon after his college graduation, offers a unique snapshot of the artist&#39;s coming-of-age as he tries to understand the world around him. Original. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>Mo Willems is the New York Times best-selling author and illustrator of picture books and early readers that have changed the face of children&#39;s literature. He has been awarded a Caldecott Honor on three occasions, and two of his Elephant and Piggie early readers have received a Theodor Seuss Geisel Medal. His most recent picture book is Naked Mole Rat Gets Dressed, of which the Bulletin of the Center for Children&#39;s Books wrote: &#34;Willems continues to be a master at conveying an amazing amount of emotion and humor using ... minimal elements&#34; in a starred review.Gr. 12 and up. After college, Caldecott Medal winner Willems took a year-long trip around the world with a backpack and a sketchpad. Every day, he drew a picture to capture the highs and lows of his experience. Now, 15 years later, his artwork has been collected and organized into this cartoon roundup, with pictures accompanied by brief explanatory passages. His trademark irony is very much on display, and even in prototypical form his style is quirky and extremely charming. But there's also a sense that readers are watching the world's longest slideshow, with intermittent insight into the curious--for example, how gravel roads in Indonesia are made, why it's important to avoid Canadian customs inspector #1508.

They never returned and to this day are still considered missing. However, one year after their disappearance, their footage was discovered. Directors Eduardo Sanchez and Gregg Hale edited the footage and released it as the movie titled <i>The Blair Witch Project</i>. As a companion to the movie, occult journalist D.A. Stern compiled this dossier, unearthing deeper mysteries surrounding the students' disappearance. It includes a full account of the case from a private investigator, police reports, newspaper articles, student profiles, interviews with the students' families and friends, and the most revealing artifact--37 pages from Heather Donahue's journal. We also get a comprehensive history of the Blair Witch legend, complete with a copy of an 1823 newspaper article. <p> The hype surrounding <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> is a rare phenomenon in which a purely fictitious film (sorry to burst the occult lover's bubble, but there is no Blair Witch myth; and those missing filmmakers are actors who are alive and well) creates a legend in and of itself. The collected data found in this dossier lends more eerie authenticity to the whole affair. This is an outstanding compilation for its acute attention to detail and ability to enhance the mystery, which in the end is the real charm of this portfolio. <i>--Samantha Allen Storey</i></p></p><h2>Great Possessions: An Amish Farmer&#39;s Journal</h2><p>An Amish farmer describes his reverence for the natural world in a collection of essays on farming, animals, plants, birds, insects, and the seasons</p><p>With horses and the help of his family and friends, David Kline practices diversified sustainable farming on 120 acres of land in the Amish community of Fredericksburg, Ohio.Combining the foresight of John Muir, the poetry of Henry David Thoreau, and the artistry of John James Audubon, Kline blends the hues of old-world Amish farm life to paint a canvas colored with the great horned owl, black-tailed grackle, and blue heron beneath a winter's wolf moon. Spring brings ploughing and planting amidst budding apple, ash, and sugar maple; the burble of bull toads; the trill of the whippoorwill; and the tickle of toothwort, thistle, and thyme. Summer draws marsh ducks, woodchucks, and young bucks to the sun-drenched cornhusks, while fall closes the circle with the tawny tints of turning leaves and the fine-honed axe of the woodcutter.

Lee Warren&#x2019;s life as a neurosurgeon in a trauma center began to unravel long before he shipped off to serve the Air Force in Iraq in 2004. When he traded a comfortable if demanding practice in San Antonio, Texas, for a ride on a C-130 into the combat zone, he was already reeling from months of personal struggle.</p><p>At the 332nd Air Force Theater Hospital at Joint Base Balad, Iraq, Warren realized his experience with trauma was just beginning. In his 120 days in a tent hospital, he was trained in a different specialty&#x2014;surviving over a hundred mortar attacks and trying desperately to repair the damages of a war that raged around every detail of every day. No place was safe, and the constant barrage wore down every possible defense, physical or psychological.</p><p>One day, clad only in a T-shirt, gym shorts, and running shoes, Warren was caught in the open while round after round of mortars shook the earth and shattered the air with their explosions, stripping him of everything he had been trying so desperately to hold on to.</p><p>Warren&#x2019;s story is an example of how a person can go from a place of total loss to one of strength, courage, and victory. Whether you are in the midst of your own crisis of faith, failed relationship, financial struggle, or illness, you will be inspired to remember that how you respond determines whether you survive&#x2014;spiritually, emotionally, and sometimes physically.</p><p>It is the beginning of a long journey home.</p></p><p><p>W.

True to Pentecostal theology, the Jimmy Swaggart Commentary collection leads its readers chapter by chapter to a better understanding of the Bible. Rather than providing notes on every Bible verse, these commentaries focus on the salient verses of each chapter to offer the reader a condensed synopsis of what the Holy Spirit intended. Where most relevant, cultural and historical references are also included, along with explanations of the allegories, types, and symbolisms used in the Bible to add depth and dimension for students of the Holy Scriptures. Yet, what seems to separate this work from all other commentaries are the biblical applications made to present day circumstances facing every believer.

He is perhaps best remembered today for his gardening books. The first of them, <i>Down the Garden Path,</i> centered on his home and garden at Glatton and has been in print almost continuously since 1932. <i>Merry Hall</i> (1951) and its sequels <i>Laughter on the Stairs</i> (1953) and <i>Sunlight on the Lawn</i> (1956) document Nichols' travails in renovating a Georgian mansion and its gardens soon after the war. His final garden was at Sudbrook Cottage, which serves as the setting for <i>Garden Open Today</i> (1963) and <i>Garden Open Tomorrow</i> (1968). The progress of all three gardens was followed avidly by readers of his books and weekly magazine columns.</p><h2>Judy</h2><p>Chronicles Judy Garland&#39;s complex and often tragic personal life as well as her professional successes and failures</p><p><b>Gerold Frank</b> was the bestselling author of <i>The Deed, The Boston Strangler,</i> and <i>An American Death.</i> He collaborated with Lillian Roth, Diana Barrymore, Sheilah Graham, and Zsa Zsa Gabor on their memoirs.</p><h2>This I Believe, and Other Essays</h2><p>Cool Tabaccco, Sweet Coca is a first-hand account by Hipolito Candre (Kinerai), an Indian healer from the Columbian Amazon.

He describes how we were formed by the "Word of tobacco and coca", the Word of life, and talks of the Planter of the True Seed, the Word of strength, the Word on discipline, the Invocation for the pregnant mother, the tasks of the mother and the father, and the care of children. He also relates traditional narratives, including the Dreams of Abundance and the story of the giant armadillo.</p><p>There is no one like Schumacher around today.

As international mycologist Ian Hall and his colleagues have written, &#x201c;Attempts at taming the truffle, of ordering its growth and harvest, now span the globe, and there has been some success in unlocking the secrets of what French researchers have aptly referred to as <i>la grande mystique</i>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The secrets of when, how, and where to collect truffles have been passed from generation to generation since ancient times, but artificial cultivation remains the holy grail. Here, in the most comprehensive practical treatment of the gastronomic treasure to date, the art and science of the high-stakes pursuit come together. This extensively illustrated volume brings the latest research and decades of experience to enthusiasts and professionals alike, with coverage of the leading truffle areas including France, Italy, Spain, and Asia, and the newcomers: Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.<br> &nbsp;<br> The authors leaven their enthusiasm and expertise with wry humor, exploring the history and newest techniques. They describe in detail the commercial species and their host plants, natural habitats, cultivation, and maintenance, pests and diseases, and harvesting with pigs, dogs, truffle flies, and even the electronic nose.&nbsp;Production in truffle plantations can begin after only three years, but often the rewards may take more than a decade.

A narrative of courage, hope, and survival, <i>Through the Valley</i> is more than just a war story. It also portrays the thrill and horror of combat, the fear and anxiety of captivity, and the stories of friendships forged and friends lost.<br><br></p><p>In 1971 William Reeder was a senior captain on his second tour in Vietnam. He had flown armed, fixed-wing OV-1 Mohawks on secret missions deep into enemy territory in Laos, Cambodia, and North Vietnam on his first tour. He returned as a helicopter pilot eager to experience a whole new perspective as a Cobra gunship pilot. Believing that Nixon's Vietnamization would soon end the war, Reeder was anxious to see combat action. To him, it appeared that the Americans had prevailed, beaten the Viet Cong, and were passing everything over to the South Vietnamese Army so that Americans could leave. <br><br></p><p>Less than a year later, while providing support to forces at the besieged base of Ben Het, Reeder's chopper went down in a flaming corkscrew. Though Reeder survived the crash, he was captured after evading the enemy for three days. He was held for weeks in jungle cages before enduring a grueling forced march on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, costing the lives of seven of his group of twenty-seven POWs. Imprisoned in the notorious prisons of Hanoi, Reeder's tenacity in the face of unimaginable hardship is not only a captivating story, but serves as an inspiration to all. <br><br></p>In <i>Through the Valley</i> William Reeder shares the torment and pain of his ordeal, but does so in the light of the hope that he never lost. His memoir reinforces the themes of courage and sacrifice, undying faith, strength of family, love of country, loyalty among comrades, and a realization of how precious is the freedom all too often taken for granted. Sure to resonate with those serving in the armed forces who continue to face the demands of combat, <i>Through the Valley</i> will also appeal especially to readers looking for a powerful, riveting story.</p><p>William Reeder is a retired Army colonel and highly decorated combat veteran of the Vietnam War. He received the Silver Star for gallantry, two Distinguished Flying Crosses for heroism, an Air Medal for valor, and three Purple Hearts for wounds received during the events related in this story. Since military retirement, he has continued to be involved in leadership training and education for the U.S. Army and NATO Special Operations Forces. In 2014, he was inducted into the U.S. Army Aviation Hall of Fame."<i>Through the Valley</i> unquestionably possesses the characteristics of a superb story and a story which is superbly told. This is a book which will benefit and be remembered by readers of a wide variety of interests. William Reeder has a special story which must be read." --<i><b>INFANTRY</b></i><br><br>"<i>Through the Valley: My Captivity in Vietnam</i> is a well-written chronicle of Army Col. Bill Reeder's time as a POW and his struggles adapting back in the 'real world.'" <i><b>The VVA Veteran</b></i><br><br>"This is a powerful book and highly recommended for readers who want a riveting account of survival against the odds." - <b><i>Military Review</i></b><br>"I believe this is a work intended for a general audience interested in the POW experience in general and the Vietnam POW experience in particular. It should also appeal to anyone interested in combat aviation as well. This is a work that has it all."<b>--Robert C. Doyle, author of <i>A Prisoner's Duty: Great Escapes in U.S. Military History</i></b><br><br>"This book's greatest value, however, is not simply as a straightforward historical account detailing one man's journey into and out of captivity. <i>Through the Valley</i> poignantly captures the profound cost of the conflict experienced not just by one observer, but by all those around him. Throughout his journey north, Reeder encountered dozens of South Vietnamese prisoners who suffered through the same captivity he did. Indeed, during the missions he flew prior to his capture, Reeder provided cover for the evacuation of American advisors from doomed South Vietnamese outposts. It is this that is perhaps the most worthwhile part of this autobiographical account. Reeder, in heartfelt detail, captures the pain and perseverance that permeates his experience in a way that is profoundly accessible to those reading it. In this respect, <i>Through the Valley</i> contributes to a rich body of writing that has helped leaders and policymakers for centuries understand the human cost associated with deciding to go to war, a cost that those they choose to send to fight will carry home with them. Costs that will influence how those people reintegrate into society, and how society changes as a result."<b>--The Strategy Bridge</b><br><br>"<i>Through the Valley: My Captivity in Vietnam</i> by William Reeder Jr. is a harrowing account of courage and bravery by a Cobra gunship pilot shot down and captured by the enemy. Suffering a broken back and horribly festering wounds, Reeder barely survived a nearly 400-mile death march to Hanoi."<b>--Robert Mason, author of <i>Chickenhawk</i></b><br><br>"The way that he (Reeder) and his fellow prisoners maintained their dignity and courage under horrendous circumstances is inspiring. The well-written autobiography is a stirring look at the trials of a prisoner of war in North Vietnam."<b><i>--Military Heritage Magazine</i></b><br><br><p></p>"He wants to be there, 'preserving the South against communist aggression and wanting to be in a tactical unit that's still in the fight.' Instead he survives a crash, lands in prison as a 'criminal,' and contracts malaria. His treatment and his memoir document why any nation ought to treat an enemy POW--in this case an American--with dignity."<b><i>--Military Times</i></b><br><br>"Reeder, a former U.S. Army colonel, shares his harrowing experience as a prisoner of war after his Cobra helicopter was shot down on May 9, 1972, near Ben Het, Vietnam. Reeder was incredibly fortunate to survive the crash, as his copilot was killed and he was severely injured: 'hanging out the side of the Cobra, head down with my feet stuck in the cockpit, the helicopter burning.' Nearly paralyzed and without a weapon, Reeder survived for three days in the jungle before being captured. Then he somehow made it through several weeks penned up in a tortuous jungle prison camp in South Vietnam, an excruciating forced march to Hanoi, and imprisonment in the infamous North Vietnamese prison known as the 'Hanoi Hilton.' With the exception of some reconstructed dialogue, the tale rings true. Reeder evocatively shares his distressing, yet ultimately uplifting, story of survival against the odds, and even though readers know Reeder will make it through, this account will keep them engaged until the end."<b><i>--Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>"Reeder tells a harrowing yet ultimately uplifting story of survival against strong odds.

One of Violet's sons is murdered, Ryan's sister is endangered, there may be Mob involvementor worsebut Blackie Ryan winds it all up most satisfactorily. Greeley's greatest gift is an apparent willingness to offend everyone. His church-scolding and Irish-bashingIrish matriarchs especiallyare honed to a fine, affectionate pitch.

What makes this account unique in the world of &#34;channeled&#34; books is that during his life, this extraordinary child was severely disabled and unable to speak. But after death his language was fluent and his words were insightful, inspired and eloquent. The messages in best-selling channeled books are overwhelmingly similar. Notable intuitives like Edgar Cayce, Jane Roberts, James Van Praagh, Sylvia Browne and Neale Donald Walsch have shared their channeled transmissions with millions, and the content is stunning in its clarity and consistency. Conversations with God, the Seth series, A Course in Miracles and countless others speak of loving entities who guide us from other realms, and they dismiss the fear-based concept of a judgmental god. Spiritual seekers are starving for alternatives to the fear and disempowerment they experienced in their childhood churches. Remarkably, all the answers are there, simply for the asking, requiring nothing more than an open heart and the understanding that we are more than these interim physical forms. Emotional and spiritual education is available to us in many forms from many sources, beyond books, schools and human experience. There are eager teachers in other realms waiting with infinite patience for us to tune in and start listening. One such teacher is Danny Mandell, who died at age 16 after struggling with a degenerative disorder that transformed him from an active, healthy seven year-old into a wheelchair-bound teenager who wore diapers, was unable to talk and could not use his hands. He was completely non-verbal during the last years of his life, but within an hour after his death, he began &#34;speaking&#34; to his mother, guiding her to publish his words in a book that would have a unique perspective, not just on the journey of the soul, but on the specific subject of intimate relationships and the power of meditation and forgiveness to transform them.</p><p><p><b>Terri Daniel</b> began her career as an author and lecturer in 1990, when she published her first book, <i>POWER SHMOOZING: The New Etiquette for Social and Business Success</i>.

Harter Black Mountain Institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. She blogs on writing at TayariJones.com/blog, and she lives in Brooklyn.Based on the Atlanta child murders of 1979-1980, this wrenching debut novel is told from the perspective of three Atlanta fifth-graders living in the midst of the crisis. Tasha is a sweet, conflicted middle-class girl navigating the harsh social waters of her school. Rodney, "the weirdest boy in class," is an unpopular kid who feels both pushed and ignored by his perfectionist parents. Octavia is a whip-smart, confident social outcast who carefully notes that she lives "across the street" from the projects. Jones, who was a child herself in Atlanta in the late '70s and early '80s, weaves her tale with consummate ease, shifting from third to second to first person as she switches narrators. The details of the children's everyday life playground fights, school cafeteria breakfasts, candy store visits are convincingly presented and provide an emotional context for the murders. When classmates begin disappearing, we know that they, along with their peers, are not one-dimensional innocents. One night when Octavia sneaks a late-night look at the local news, she sees a now-missing classmate flash on the screen. "In the picture he looked like a regular boy from our class. He was by himself so you couldn't tell that he was shorter than most of them and just nicer and smarter than all of them put together. Kodak commercials say that a picture is worth a thousand words, but the one they showed of Rodney ain't worth more than three or four. Boy. Black. Dead." This strongly grounded tale hums with the rhythms of schoolyard life and proves Jones to be a powerful storyteller.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Ministry of Fear: An Entertainment</h2><p>Set in the torn landscape of the Blitz, this book is a phantasmagoric study in terror.

When the Nazis seized control in Germany, she was stripped down for use as a floating barracks and troop transport. Later, during the war, Hitler's minister, Joseph Goebbels, cast her as the "star" in his epic propaganda film about the sinking of the legendary <i>Titanic</i>.<br><br>Following the film's enormous failure, the German navy used the <i>Cap Arcona</i> to transport German soldiers and civilians across the Baltic, away from the Red Army's advance. In the Third Reich's final days, the ill-fated ship was packed with thousands of concentration camp prisoners. Without adequate water, food, or sanitary facilities, the prisoners suffered as they waited for the end of the war. Just days before Germany surrendered, the <i>Cap Arcona</i> was mistakenly bombed by the British Royal Air Force, and nearly all of the prisoners were killed in the last major tragedy of the Holocaust and one of history's worst maritime disasters.<br><br>Although the British government sealed many documents pertaining to the ship's sinking, Robert P.

In the process Fuchs becomes the first-ever documented westerner to travel and document the route in its entirety. <br> &nbsp;<br> A team of six mountain men begin a 5000 km, seven-and-a-half month journey to travel the entire length of one of ancient world's most inspired journeys, The Tea Horse Road. &nbsp;Along the way the reader is gifted with descriptions of isolated customs of ancient China, of wrong turns in the mountains, and a raft of comical interactions between the team members. Passing through Yunnan, Sichuan, Tibet, Nepal, and India, the Tea Horse Road's grand expanse is revealed in stunning detail through Fuchs' narrative.

But first, he must find them.<br> &nbsp;<br> An epic journey of tea, mountains, and memories, that opens up a rarely acknowledged part of China and Asia's ancient past, "The Ancient Tea Horse Road" is a grinding adventure of will, wit, and tea thirsts. &nbsp;Life along the Tea Horse Road is briefly re-ignited in a passionate and unforgettable adventure.</p><p>Jeff Fuchs is a Canadian award-winning explorer, author and tea purveyor who is based in Zhongdian (Shangri-La) in northwestern Yunnan, China. Fuchs came to prominence when he became the first westerner ever to travel and document the entire length of the Tea Horse Road; a journey that took more than seven months and ranged over 5,000 kilometers through Yunnan, Sichuan, Tibet, Nepal, and India. Fuchs was described by feature writer Bill Roberts in an expedition piece in Outpost Magazine, as a &#34;charmingly volatile mix of Anglo-Hungarian genes&#34;, and a &#34;languid hard man with a soft touch&#34;. Fuchs was awarded the 2011 Wild China Explorer of the Year for his first western documentation and expedition along a nomadic salt route in southern Qinghai, province (Amdo). As well as acting as a mountain guide in Yunnan province, Fuchs is the co-founder of Jalamteas, which sources rare Puerh teas from southern Yunnan, and is a self-confessed tea addict. He works with Wild China running award-winning journeys along the Tea Horse Road. His most recent expedition was to lead a Canadian team along a never-before documented pilgrim path culminating in the legendary and sacred 4,800 meter Sho&#39;la Pass on the Yunnan-Tibet border. His photos and stories have appeared on three continents in award-winning publications such as UNESCO, Kyoto Journal, TRVL, Outpost, and the South China Post Newspaper amongst others. His photo work of indigenous people rests in private collections around the world. Jeff, who is fluent in Mandarin and Tibetan has worked with schools and universities, giving talks the importance of oral traditions, tea, and mountain cultures.

Sierva Maria appears completely unscathed - but as rumours of the plague spread, the Marquis and his wife wonder at her continuing good health. In a town consumed by superstition, it&#39;s not long before they, and everyone else, put her survival down to a demonic possession and begin to see her supernatural powers as the cause of the town&#39;s woes.

Sierva Maria, only child of a decaying noble family, has been raised in the slaves' courtyard of her father's cobwebbed mansion while her mother succumbs to fermented honey and cacao on a faraway plantation. On her twelfth birthday the girl is bitten by a rabid dog, and even as the wound is healing she is made to endure therapies indistinguishable from tortures. Believed, finally, to be possessed, she is brought to a convent for observation. And into her cell stumbles Father Cayetano Delaura, the Bishop's protege, who has already dreamed about a girl with hair trailing after her like a bridal train; who is already moved by this kicking, spitting, emaciated creature strapped to a stone bed. As he tends to her with holy water and sacramental oils, Delaura feels "something immense and irreparable" happening to him. It is love, "the most terrible demon of all."

At 18 the Mobile, Ala.-born athlete was signed by the Indianapolis Clowns and within months was on his way to organized white baseball. He helped to integrate the South Atlantic (Sally) League--a horrible experience--and within two years was playing for the Braves in Milwaukee, Wis., a city that loved him; after 13 years the team moved to Atlanta, where he was shown little affection. Each chapter begins with a scene-setting introduction by Wheeler, then Aaron takes over, aided by reminiscences of boyhood friends, former teammates and baseball executives. The book is as much a social document as a memoir, for Aaron is militant on race relations and views himself as a major successor to Jackie Robinson in the fight to end sports racism, which he finds widely practiced still.

It is the first-hand account of the prejudice faced by Aaron and his contemporaries who followed Jackie Robinson into the big leagues. The narrative is modest yet supremely confident ; from it emerges a picture of an incredibly talented man who fought for the opportunities he deserved. During the 23 years he played the game, Aaron became the best hitter of all time, surpassing even Ted Williams and Willie Mays.

In this sense, today it is especially relevant to look at ancient Egypt with fresh eyes. The evolution of Western civilization has been profoundly influenced by Egyptian myths through the Greek mysteries. Because of other influences, however, this heritage has degenerated; thinking has mummified and and myth has all but disappeared. Consequently, it is important to revive the seed of goodness passed down to us from ancient Egypt. <br><br>Through true imagination, it is our task to renew human knowledge related to the creative forces in nature, which the Egyptians attempted through the Osiris-Isis myth, and the Greeks through the myth of Demeter. This is what Rudolf Steiner attempts in this lecture cycle. <br><br>Steiner's subjects include: experiences of Egyptian initiations; esoteric anatomy and physiology; the stages of evolution of the human form; and much more. The final lecture is on the Christ impulse as the conqueror of matter.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

Raymer... implies that design involves far more than drawing a pretty shape and then shoe-horning people, engines, and structural members into it. It involves art. Raymer&#39;s book... takes a practical, rather than academic, view of the development of a design.

The civil war hadn't been the longest in all of recorded history, but no doubt it was one of the bloodiest. Those who had entered a little too quickly into the carnage and destruction had trouble adapting to life during peacetime. When hostilities ceased, they ran amok on the streets of Wonderland's capital city, looting and pillaging Wondertropolis until Queen Genevieve had them rounded up and shipped off to the Crystal Mines&#x2014;a spiderweb-like network of tunnels carved in a far-off mountainside, where those unwilling to abide by the laws of decent society lived in windowless dormitories and labored to excavate crystal from the unforgiving mountain. Even after these people were taken off the streets, the peace that settled on Wonderland was nothing like that which had existed before the war. A third of Wondertropolis' quartz-like buildings had to be rebuilt. The smooth turquoise amphitheater had suffered damage in an air raid, as had the public works towers and spires sporting fiery, reflective pyrite skin. But the scars of war are not always visible. Although Queen Genevieve ruled her queendom judiciously, with care for the well-being of her people, the monarchy had forever been weakened. The coalition of Diamond, Club, and Spade dynasties that made up Parliament were falling apart. The matriarchs of the families were jealous of Genevieve's power. Each thought she could rule Wonderland better then the queen. Each watched and waited for an opportunity to wrest control from her, keeping a none-too-friendly eye on the other families in case they happened to make a move first. </p><p>Entertaining no thoughts of war, Princess Alyss Heart stood on the balcony of Heart Palace with her mother, Queen Genevieve. The city was in the midst of a jubilant gala. From the Everlasting Forest to the Valley of Mushrooms, Wonderlanders had come to celebrate the seventh birthday of their future queen, who, as it happened, was bored out of her wits. Alyss knew she could do a lot worse than be Queen of Wonderland, but even a future monarch doesn't always want to do what she is supposed to do&#x2014;like site through hours of pageantry. She would rather have hidden with her friend Dodge in one of the palace towers, dropping jollyjellies from an open window and watching them splat on the guards below. Dodge wouldn't like the jollyjelly bit&#x2014;guardsmen deserved better treatment, he'd say&#x2014;but that would only make it more fun. </p><p>Where <i>was</i> Dodge anyway? She hadn't seen him all morning, and it wasn't nice to avoid the birthday girl on her birthday. She searched for him among the Wonderlanders gathered to watch the Inventors' Parade on the cobbled lane below. No sign of him. He was probably off doing something fun; whatever it was had to be more fun than being stuck here, forced to watch Wonderlanders show off their silly contraptions. Bibwit Harte, the royal tutor, had explained to her that most of Wonderland took pride in the Inventors' Parade, the one time every year when citizens flaunted their skills and ingenuity before the queen. If Genevieve saw something in the parade that she thought particularly good, she would send it into the Heart Crystal&#x2014;a thirty-three-foot-tall, fifty-two-foot-wide shimmering crystal on the palace grounds, the power source for all creation. Whatever passed into the crystal went out into the universe to inspire imaginations in other worlds. If a Wonderlander bounced in front of Queen Genevieve on a spring-operated stick with handlebars and footrests and she passed this curious invention into the crystal, before long, in one civilization or another, a pogo stick would be invented. </p><p>Still, Alyss wondered, what was the big deal? Having to stand here until her feet hurt&#x2014;it was punishment. </p><p>"I wish Father was here." </p><p>"He's due back form Boarderland at any moment," said Queen Genevieve. "But since the rest of Wonderland is here, I suggest you try to enjoy yourself for their sake. That's interesting, don't you think?" </p><p>They watched as a man floated down from the sky with what looked like a hollow mushroom cap strapped to his back. </p><p>"It's pretty good, I suppose," said Alyss, " but it'd be better if it were furry." </p><p>And with that, the mushroom contraption was suddenly covered with fur, its inventor falling to the ground with a thump. </p><p>Queen Genevieve frowned. </p><p>"He's late," Alyss said. "He promised he'd be here. I don't understand why he had to make a trip so close to my birthday." </p><p>There <i>were</i> reasons, as the queen well knew. Intelligence had indicated that they may have already waited too long. Unconfirmed reports suggested Redd was growing more powerful, outfitting her troops for an attack, and Genevieve was no longer sure that her military could provide adequate defense. She was as keen as Alyss for King Nolan's return, but she had determined to enjoy the day's festivities. </p><p>"Ooh, look at that," she said, pointing at a woman wiggling as she walked so as to keep a large hoop swinging round and round her waist." That looks diverting." </p><p>"It'd be more fun if it had fountains of water coming out of it," Alyss said, and immediately the hoop was spurting water from tiny holes all along its surface, the surprised inventor still wiggling to keep it swinging round and round. </p><p>"Birthday or not, Alyss," Queen Genevieve said, "I don't think it's nice to show off." </p><p>The fur on the first-ever parachute vanished. The fountains of water on the newly invented hula hoop dried up. The power of Alyss' imagination had made them appear and disappear. Imagination was an important part of life in Wonderland, and Alyss had the most powerful imagination ever seen in a seven year-old Wonderlander. But as with any formidable talent, Alyss' imagination could be used for good or ill, and the queen saw mild reasons for concern. Hardly one revolution of the Thurmite moon had passed since Alyss' last incident: Impatient with young Jack of Diamonds for some childish indiscretion, she's imagined his trousers filled with slick, squiggling gwormmies. Jack of Diamonds had said he "felt something funny," looked down, and saw that his trousers were moving, alive. He'd been having nightmares ever since. Alyss claimed not to have done it on purpose, which may or may not have been true, Genevieve couldn't tell. Alyss didn't yet have full control of her imaginative powers, but the girl would say anything to get out of trouble. </p><p>"You will be the strongest queen yet," she told her daughter. "Your imagination will be the crowning achievement of the land. But Alyss, you must work hard to develop it according to the guiding principles of the Heart dynasty&#x2014;love, justice, and duty to the people. An undisciplined imagination is worse than no imagination at all. It can do more harm. Remember what happened to your aunt Redd." </p><p>"I know," Alyss said sulkily. She had never met her aunt Redd, but she'd heard storied about the woman for as long as she could remember. She didn't bother trying to understand it all; it was <i>history</i>&#x2014;boring boring boring. But she knew that to be like her aunt Redd wasn't good. </p><p>"Now that's enough lecturing for one princess' birthday," Queen Genevieve said. She clapped her hands and the parachute and hula hoop passed into the Heart Crystal, much to the joy of their inventors. </p><p>An empty pair of King Nolan's boots floated out from behind the balcony door and began to dance in front of the brooding princess. </p><p>Queen Genevieve, watching yet another extraordinary display of her daughter's imagination, said, "Alyss." </p><p>Something in her tone made the girl stop what she was doing. The boots thudded to the ground, still. </p><p>"It's all in your head," the queen sighed. "Remember that, love. Whatever happens, it's all in your head." </p><p>It was both a warning and an expression of hope: Queen Genevieve, aware of the dark forces at work somewhere in the wastes of the Chessboard Desert, knew that joy and happiness didn't last forever in Wonderland; sooner or later the queendom would come under attack, and it would require all of Alyss' imaginative powers&#x2014;and then some&#x2014;to ensure its survival. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Beatles Illustrated Lyrics</h2><p>A compilation of the lyrics to the nearly two hundred songs written by the Beatles and symbolic of the musical and social climate of the 1960s</p><p></p><h2>The Feingold Cookbook for Hyperactive Children</h2><p>Explains the problems of dietary management, brings the scientific evidence up-to-date and provides a list of forbidden foods.

Creation stories, tales of magic dogs and lost children, adventures of cultural heroes, and silly stories about Crazy Jack?a wise fool who, like Amelia Bedilia, takes everything literally?make for rich and varied reading. The editor has wisely chosen not to retell the stories; instead, he honors the storytellers and their culture by reprinting the original texts.

A clear, informative, respectful preface gives a short history of the Lenape and discusses the different ways the selections were recorded.

The young couple left New York City in 1937 to live on the Maine farm where they first met. By the early 1940s, she had nearly given up thoughts of writing and illustrating books, but was contacted by a New York publisher to illustrate The Little Fisherman, the latest title by Margaret Wise Brown. This charming title helped launch a four-decade run that saw her write and illustrate more than thirty children&#39;s books of her own. Today, her artwork is known worldwide, with pieces in the collections of numerous renowned museums. Meanwhile, she still lives and paints in the 1860s farmhouse that she shared with Adolph for nearly seventy years.</p><h2>Simplify Your Riding: Step-By-Step Techniques to Improve Your Riding Skills</h2><p>This step-by-step how-to book for equestrians of all disciplines offers an illustrated, easy-to-follow series of progressive horseback riding lessons.</p><p></p><h2>Marguerite, Go Wash Your Feet</h2><p>A collection of amusing verses by a variety of poets, including Emily Dickinson, Spike Milligan, Shakespeare, and others less well known.</p><p>Wallace Tripp is a contributor for Houghton Mifflin Company titlesGrade 3 Up Tripp has provided another lushly illustrated, madcap anthology of nonsense poetry and quotes, a worthy successor to his Granfa' Grig Had a Pig &amp; Other Rhymes Without Reason from Mother Gooseu (1976) and A Great Big Ugly Man Came Up &amp; Tied His Horse to Me (1973, both Little).

Suddenly, a car-bomb explodes, killing and injuring scores of innocent people. From the second-floor window of a building across the street, a visiting American watches, helpless, as his beloved wife and children are sacrificed in the heat and fire of someone else&#39;s cause. From this shocking beginning, the author of the phenomenal Dune series has created a masterpiece. The White Plague is a marvelous and terrifyingly plausible blend of fiction and visionary theme. It tells of one man&#39;s revenge, of the man watching from the window who is pushed over the edge of sanity by the senseless murder of his family and who, reappearing several months later as the so-called Madman, unleashes a terrible vengeance upon the human race. For John Roe O&#39;Neill is a molecular biologist who has the knowledge, and now the motivation, to devise and disseminate a genetically carried plague-a plague to which, like those that scourged mankind centuries ago, there is no antidote, but one that zeros in, unerringly and fatally, on women. As the world slowly recognizes the reality of peril, as its politicians and scientists strive desperately to save themselves and their society from the prospect of human extinction, so does Frank Herbert grapple with one of the great themes of contemporary life: the enormous dangers that lurk at the dark edges of science. The White Plague is a prophetic, believable, and utterly compelling novel.</p><p><b>Frank Herbert</b> was born in Tacoma, Washington, and educated at the University of Washington, Seattle. He worked a wide variety of jobs--including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers--before becoming a full-time writer. He died in 1986.<i>May the hearthstone of hell be his bed rest forever!</i> <i>&#x2014;Old Irish Curse</i> <br> <br>It was an ordinary gray British Ford, the spartan economy model with right-hand drive customary in Ireland. John Roe O&#x2019;Neill would remember the driver&#x2019;s brown-sweatered right arm resting on the car&#x2019;s windowsill in the cloud-filtered light of that Dublin afternoon. A nightmare capsule of memory, it excluded everything else in the scene; just the car and that arm. Several other surviving witnesses commented on a crumpled break in the Ford&#x2019;s left front wing. The break had begun to rust. Speaking from her hospital bed, one witness said: &#x201c;The break was a jagged thing and I was afraid someone would be cut if they brushed against it.&#x201d; Two of those who recalled seeing the car come out of Lower Leeson Street knew the driver casually, but only from his days in postal uniform. He was Francis Bley, a retired postman working part-time as a watchman at a building site in Dun Laoghaire. Bley left for work early every Wednesday, giving himself time to run a few errands and then pick up his wife, Tessie. On that one day each week, Tessie spent the morning doing &#x201c;light secretarial&#x201d; for a betting shop in King Street. It was Tessie&#x2019;s habit to spend the rest of the day with her widowed sister who lived in a remodeled gatehouse off the Dun Laoghaire bypass &#x201c;just a few minutes out of his way.&#x201d; This was a Wednesday. May 20. Bley was on his way to pick up Tessie. The Ford&#x2019;s left front door, although appearing undamaged by the accident that had crumpled the wing, still required a twist of wire around the doorpost to keep it closed. The door rattled every time the car hit a bump. &#x201c;I heard it rattling when it turned onto St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green South,&#x201d; one&nbsp;witness said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s God&#x2019;s own mercy I wasn&#x2019;t at the Grafton corner when it happened.&#x201d; Bley turned right off St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green South, which put him on St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green West, hugging the left lane as he headed for Grafton Street. There were better routes for him to make his connection with Tessie, but this was &#x201c;his way.&#x201d; &#x201c;He liked to see all the people,&#x201d; Tessie said. &#x201c;God rest him, that&#x2019;s what he said he missed most when he quit the postal&#x2014;all the people.&#x201d; Bley, slight and wrinkled, had that skin-stretched cadaverous look that is common among certain aged Celts from the south of Ireland. He wore a soiled brown hat almost the exact shade of his patched sweater, and he drove with the patient detachment of someone who came this way often. And if the truth were known, he rather liked being slowed by the heavy traffic. It had been cold and wet through most of spring and, while it was still cloudy, the cloud cover had thinned and there was a feeling that there might be a break in the weather. Only a few of the pedestrians carried umbrellas. The trees of St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green on Bley&#x2019;s right were in full leaf. As the Ford inched along in the congested traffic, the man watching for it from a fourth-floor window of the Irish Film Society Building nodded once in satisfaction. <i>Right on time.</i> Bley&#x2019;s Ford had been selected because of this Wednesday punctuality. There was also the fact that Bley did not garage his car where he and Tessie lived in Davitt Road. The Ford was parked outside beside a thick yew hedge, which could be approached from the street along a path shielded by a parked van. There had been a van parked in this covering position the previous night. Neighbors had seen it but no one had thought to comment at the time. &#x201c;There were often vehicles parked in that place,&#x201d; one said. &#x201c;How were we to know?&#x201d; The watcher at the Film Society Building had many names but he had been born Joseph Leo Herity. He was a small, solidly fleshy man with a long, thin face and pale, almost translucent skin. Herity wore his blond hair combed straight back and hanging almost to the collar. His light brown eyes were deeply set and he had a pugged nose with prominent nostrils from which hair protruded. From his fourth-floor vantage, Herity commanded an overview of the entire setting for the drama he was about to ignite. Directly across from him, the tall trees of the green formed a verdant wall enclosing the flow of vehicles and pedestrians. The Robert Emmet statue stood opposite his window and, to the left of it, there was a black-on-white sign to the public toilets. Bley&#x2019;s Ford had stopped with the traffic just to the left of Herity&#x2019;s window. A&nbsp;white tour bus with blue-and-red stripes down its side loomed over the small Ford. Traffic fumes were thick even at the fourth-floor level. Herity checked Bley&#x2019;s license number to be certain.&nbsp; <i>Yes&#x2014;JIA-5028</i>. Then there was the crumpled left front wing. The traffic began to inch forward, then stopped once more. Herity glanced left at the Grafton Street corner. He could see the signs of the Toy World shop and the Irish Permanent Society on the ground floor of the red brick building soon to be taken over by the Ulster Bank. There had been some protest about that, one ragged march with a few signs, but it had died out quickly. The Ulster Bank had powerful friends in the government. <i>Barney and his lot,</i>&nbsp;Herity thought.&nbsp; <i>They think we&#x2019;re ignorant of their scheme to make a peace with the Ulster boys!</i> Again, Bley&#x2019;s Ford inched toward the corner, but once more was stopped. There was heavy foot traffic where Grafton took off from St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green. A bald-headed man in a dark blue suit had stopped almost directly beneath Herity&#x2019;s window and was examining the cinema marquee. Two young men pushing bicycles threaded their way past the bald-headed man. The traffic remained stopped. Herity looked down at the top of Bley&#x2019;s car. So innocent-looking, that car. Herity had been one of the two-man team to emerge from the yewshrouded van near Bley&#x2019;s parking spot the previous night. In Herity&#x2019;s hands had been a molded plastic package, which they had attached like a deformed limpet under Bley&#x2019;s car. At the core of that package lay a tiny radio receiver. The transmitter sat on the windowsill in front of Herity. A small black metal rectangle, it had a thin wire antenna and two recessed toggle switches&#x2014;one painted yellow, the other red. Yellow armed it, red transmitted. A glance at his wristwatch told Herity that they were already five minutes past Zero Time. Not Bley&#x2019;s fault. It was the blasted traffic. &#x201c;You can set your bloody watch by Bley,&#x201d; the leader of their selection team had said. &#x201c;The old bastard should be running a tram.&#x201d; &#x201c;What&#x2019;re his politics?&#x201d; Greaves had asked. &#x201c;Who cares about his politics?&#x201d; Herity had countered. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s perfect and he&#x2019;ll be dying for a grand cause.&#x201d; &#x201c;The street&#x2019;ll be full of people,&#x201d; Greaves had said. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;ll be tourists sure as hell is full of Brits.&#x201d; &#x201c;We warned&#x2019;em to stop the Ulster boys,&#x201d; Herity had said.&nbsp; <i>Greaves could be an old woman sometimes!</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;They know what to expect when they don&#x2019;t listen to us.&#x201d; It was settled then. And now Bley&#x2019;s car was inching once more toward the Grafton Street corner, toward the mass of pedestrians, including the possible tourists. John Roe O&#x2019;Neill, his wife, Mary, and their five-year-old twins, Kevin and Mairead, could have been classified as tourists, although John expected to be six months in Ireland while completing the research called for under his grant from the Pastermorn Foundation of New Haven, Conn. &#x201c;An Overview of Irish Genetic Research.&#x201d; He thought the title pompous, but it was only a cover. The real research was into the acceptance of the new genetics by a Roman Catholic society, whether such a society had taken a position to cope with the explosive potentials in molecular biology. The project was much on his mind that Wednesday morning but necessary preparations required his attention. High on his list was the need to transfer funds from America to the Allied Irish Bank. Mary wanted to go shopping for sweaters &#x201c;to keep our darlings warm of an evening.&#x201d; &#x201c;There y&#x2019; go,&#x201d; John teased as they left the Sherbourne Hotel, stepping into the rush of tourists and businessmen. &#x201c;Only four days in Ireland and already you sound like a local.&#x201d; &#x201c;And why not?&#x201d; she demanded. &#x201c;And both my grandmothers from Limerick.&#x201d; They laughed, drawing a few curious stares. The children tugged at Mary, anxious to be off shopping. Ireland suited Mary, John thought. She had pale clear skin and dark blue eyes. Jet-black hair&#x2014;&#x201c;Spanish Hair,&#x201d; her family called it&#x2014;framed her rather round face. A sweet face. Irish skin and Irish features. He bent and kissed her before leaving. It brought a blush to her face but she was pleased at his show of affection and she gave him a warm smile as they parted. John walked away briskly, humming to himself, amused when he recognized the tune: &#x201c;Oh What a Beautiful Mornin&#x2019;.&#x201d; John&#x2019;s Wednesday appointment for &#x201c;transfer of foreign funds&#x201d; was at two P.M. at the Allied Irish Bank, Grafton and Chatham streets. There was a sign just inside the bank&#x2019;s entrance, white letters on black: &#x201c;Non Branch Customers Upstairs.&#x201d; A uniformed guard led him up the stairs to the office of the bank manager, Charles Mulrain, a small, nervous man with tow-colored hair and pale blue eyes behind gold-framed glasses. Mulrain had a habit of touching the comers of his mouth with a forefinger, first left side then right, followed by a quick downward brush of his dark tie. He made a joke about having his office on the first floor, &#x201c;what you Americans call the second floor.&#x201d; &#x201c;It is confusing until you catch on,&#x201d; John agreed. &#x201c;Well!&#x201d; A quick touching of lips and tie. &#x201c;You understand that we&#x2019;d normally do this at our main office, but &#x2026;&#x201d; &#x201c;When I called, they assured me it was &#x2026;&#x201d; &#x201c;As a convenience to the customer,&#x201d; Mulrain said. He lifted a folder from his desk, glanced inside it, nodded. &#x201c;Yes, this amount &#x2026; if you&#x2019;ll make&nbsp;yourself comfortable here, I&#x2019;ll just get the proper forms and be right back.&#x201d; Mulrain left, giving John a tight smile at the door. John went to the window and pulled back a heavy lace curtain to look down on Grafton Street. The sidewalks were thick with people all the way up to the arched gateway into St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green two short blocks up Grafton. The motor traffic was two abreast filling the street and crawling along toward him. There was a workman cleaning the parapet on the roof of the shopping center diagonally across the street&#x2014;a white-coated figure with a long-handled brush. He stood outlined against a row of five chimney pots. Glancing at the closed door of the manager&#x2019;s office, John wondered how long Mulrain would be. Everything was so damned formal here. John looked at his watch. Mary would arrive with the children in a few minutes. They planned to have tea, then John would walk down Grafton to Trinity College and begin work at the college library&#x2014;the real start of his research project. Much later, John would look back on those few minutes at the bank manager&#x2019;s &#x201c;first-floor&#x201d; window and think how another sequence of events had been set in motion without his knowledge, an inescapable thing like a movie. film where one frame followed another without ever the chance to deviate. It all centered around Francis Bley&#x2019;s.old car and a small VHF transmitter in the hands of a determined man watching from an open window that looked down on that corner where Grafton met St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green. Bley, patient as always, eased along at the traffic&#x2019;s pace. Herity, in his window vantage point, toggled the arming switch of his transmitter, making sure the antenna wire dangled out over the sill. As he neared the Grafton corner, the crush of pedestrians forced Bley to stop and he missed the turn of the traffic light. He heard the tour bus gain clear of traffic off to his right, trundling off in a rumble of its heavy diesel. Barricades were being erected on the building to his left and a big white-onred sign had been raised over the rough construction: &#x201c;This Building to be Remodeled by G. Tottenham Sons, Ltd.&#x201d; Bley looked to his right and noted the tall blue-and-white Prestige Cafeteria sign, feeling a small pang of hunger. The pedestrian isthmus beside him was jammed with people waiting to cross over to St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green and others struggling to make a way through the cars stopped on Grafton and blocking Bley&#x2019;s path. The crush of pedestrians was particularly heavy around Bley&#x2019;s car, people passing both front and back. A woman in a brown tweed coat, a white parcel clutched under her right elbow and each hand grasping a hand off a small child, hesitated at the right front corner of Bley&#x2019;s car while she sought an opening through the press of people. John Roe O&#x2019;Neill, standing at the bank manager&#x2019;s window, recognized Mary. He saw her first because of her familiar tweed coat and the way she carried her head, that sleek cap of jet hair. He smiled. The twins were&nbsp;screened from him by the hurrying adults but he knew from Mary&#x2019;s stance that she held the children&#x2019;s hands. A brief break in the throng allowed John a glimpse of the top of Kevin&#x2019;s head and the old Ford with the driver&#x2019;s brown-sweatered elbow protruding. <i>Where is that damned bank manager?</i>&nbsp;John wondered.&nbsp; <i>She&#x2019;ll be here any minute</i>. He dropped the heavy lace curtain and looked once more at his wristwatch. Herity, at the open window above and behind Bley, nodded once more to himself. He stepped back away from the window and toggled the second switch on his transmitter. Bley&#x2019;s car exploded, ripped apart from the bottom. The bomb, exploding almost under Bley&#x2019;s feet, drove him upward with a large piece of the car&#x2019;s roof, his body crushed, dismembered and scattered. The large section of roof sailed upward in a slow arc to come crashing onto the Irish Permanent Society Building, demolishing chimney pots and slates. It was not a large bomb as such things went, but it had been expertly placed. The old car was transformed into jagged bits of metal and glass&#x2014;an orange ball of fire peppered with deadly shrapnel. A section of the car&#x2019;s bonnet decapitated Mary O&#x2019;Neill. The twins became part of a bloody puddle blown against the iron fencing across the street at St. Stephen&#x2019;s Green. Their bodies were more easily identified later because they were the only children of that age in the throng. Herity did not pause to glance out at his work; the sound told it all. He tucked the transmitter into a small and worn military green pack, stuffed an old yellow sweater onto it, strapped the cover and slung the pack over his shoulder. He left the building by the back way, elated and satisfied. Barney and his group would get this message! John O&#x2019;Neill had looked up from his wristwatch just in time to see the orange blast envelop Mary. He was saved from the window&#x2019;s shattered glass by the heavy curtains, which deflected all but one of the shards away from him. One small section of glass creased his scalp. The shock wave staggered him, driving him backward against a desk. He fell sideways, momentarily unconscious but getting quickly to his knees as the bank manager rushed into the room, shouting: &#x201c;Good God! What was that?&#x201d; John stumbled to his feet, rejecting the question and the answer that rumbled through his head like an aftershock of the blast. He brushed past the bank manager and out the door. His mind remained in shock but his body found its way down the stairs. He shouldered a woman aside at the foot of the stairs and lurched out onto the street where he allowed himself to be carried along by the crowd rushing toward the area of the blast. There was a smell of burnt iron in the air and the sound of cries and screams. Within only a few seconds John was part of a crush being held back by police and uninjured civilians pressed into service to keep the area around the explosion clear. John elbowed and clawed his way forward. &#x201c;My wife!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;I saw her. She was there. My wife and our ...</p><h2>Victims: An Alex Delaware Novel</h2><p>Unraveling the madness behind L.A.&#x2019;s most baffling and brutal homicides is what sleuthing psychologist Alex Delaware does best.

Six hundred thousand civilians died, and three and a half million homes were destroyed. When it has cast such a very dark shadow over his life and work, Sebald asks, how have so many writers allowed themselves to write it out of their experience and avoid articulating the horror W.G. Sebald&#39;s On the Natural History of Destruction sparked a wide-ranging debate in the German press.&#39;Sebald makes exquisite art out of vile history&#39; Boyd Tonkin, Independent&#39;One of the most important writers of our time&#39; A.S.

Sebald was born in Wertach im Allgu, Germany, in 1944 and died in December 2001. He studied German language and literature in Freiburg, Switzerland and Manchester. In 1996 he took up a position as an assistant lecturer at the University of Manchester and settled permanently in England in 1970. He was Professor of European Literature at the University of East Anglia and is the author of The Emigrants, The Rings of Saturn, Vertigo, Austerlitz, After Nature, On the Natural History of Destruction, Campo Santo, Unrecounted, For Years Now and A Place in the Country.

Sebald&#x2019;s harrowing and precise investigation of one of the least examined &#x201c;silences&#x201d; of our time. In it, the acclaimed novelist examines the devastation of German cities by Allied bombardment, and the reasons for the astonishing absence of this unprecedented trauma from German history and culture.<br><br>This void in history is in part a repression of things -- such as the death by fire of the city of Hamburg at the hands of the RAF -- too terrible to bear. But rather than record the crises about them, writers sought to retrospectively justify their actions under the Nazis. For Sebald, this is an example of deliberate cultural amnesia; his analysis of its effects in and outside Germany has already provoked angry and painful debate.<br><br>Sebald&#x2019;s incomparable novels are r"Most writers, even good ones, write of what can be written; and move by their own angles into the discourse of their day. The very greatest write of what cannot be written; gravitating not toward the discourse but toward the silence. They break it, like the crust on untrodden snow.

With The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Agatha Christie's cerebral and eccentric Belgian detective steps out of retirement and into the limelight of a classic mystery.<p>Styles Court is a magnificent English manor house owned by a rich, strong-willed matron who, to the dismay of her stepson, has recently married a fortune hunter. The scene is set for death by violence. The murder of the mistress of Styles Court is so baffling, so cleverly-plotted, that it challenges even the skill of Hercule Poirot, notwithstanding the legions of tiny gray cells that take residence in his ever-so-fertile mind.</p>Who poisoned the wealthy Emily Inglethorpe, and how did the murderer penetrate and escape from her locked bedroom? Sus-pects abound in the quaint village of Styles St. Mary--from the heiress's fawning new husband to her two stepsons, her volatile housekeeper, and a pretty nurse who works in a hospital dispensary. Making his unforgettable debut, the brilliant Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is on the case. <br>"The key to the success of this style of detective novel," writes Elizabeth George in her Introduction, "lies in how the author deals with both the clues and the red herrings, and it has to be said that no one bettered Agatha Christie at this game."</p><h2>UFOs, JFK, and Elvis: Conspiracies You Don&#39;t Have to Be Crazy to Believe</h2><p>"I'm not asking you to believe every conspiracy theory you'll find in this book. . . .

Maybe. But the fact is, when he's not busting criminals on TV, the acid-tongued, legendary search-and-destroy comic known affectionately as "The Belz" is doing real-life detective work: searching out evidence, sifting through long-buried facts, and destroying popular misconceptions involving everything from the JFK assassination ("There's only one living member of the Warren Commission, and that's Gerald Ford. He's also the dumbest member of the Warren Commission.

Just remember: do not ask on whom The Belz has told--he's told on them.</p><p>Best known as Detective John Munch on the hit TV series <i>Homicide</i>, Richard Belzer is also an accomplished standup comedian with a knack for political commentary in the tradition of Mort Sahl and Dick Gregory. In <i>UFOs, JFK, and Elvis</i>, he applies his analytic powers to two of the most controversial topics of the late 20th century: the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 and the alleged U.S. government cover-up of the existence of alien life. (The reference in the title is the book's only substantial Elvis sighting.)<p> Belzer sensibly avoids pretending to have the answers, opting instead to focus on the questions themselves. Why does the Zapruder film fail to synchronize with other footage of the Kennedy shooting? What's the real background on Lee Harvey Oswald--and who really posed for that famous backyard photo? Did NASA regularly suppress UFO sightings by <i>Apollo</i> and <i>Gemini</i> astronauts? And how about that giant face on the surface of Mars? While Belzer's sarcastic, antiauthoritarian tone may not convince you that aliens walk among us, it's rather difficult by book's end to fully dismiss his belief that "history is just a collection of accepted lies" told to keep the masses in line. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>In UFOs, JFK, and Elvis, the distinguished statesman of stand-up comedy tackles some of the biggest conspiracies and cover-ups this side of Roswell.

How do you buy the high-tech win-ners and avoid the losers? How do you find the Yahoo!s, Microsofts, and Ciscos of tomorrow?</p><p> The answers are here, in this newly revised edition of the national bestseller <em>The Gorilla Game.</em> The book reveals the dynamics driving the market for high-tech stocks and out-lines the forces that catapult a select number of compa-nies to "gorilla" status--dominating the markets they serve in the way that Yahoo! dominates internet portals, Microsoft dominates software operating systems, and Cisco dominates hardware for data networks.</p><p> Follow the rules of <em>The Gorilla Game</em> and you will learn how to identify and invest in the "gorilla candidates" early on--while they are still fighting for dominance, and while their stocks are still cheap. When the dust clears and one company clearly attains leadership in its market, you'll reap the enormous returns that foresighted investors in high-tech companies deserve.</p><p>This new edition of <em>The Gorilla Game</em> has been updated and revised throughout, with new focus and new insights into choosing the internet gorillas--the companies that are destined to dominate internet commerce.</p><p>Bestselling author Geoffrey A. Moore is one of the world's leading consultants in high-tech marketing strategy. Here you'll find his groundbreaking ideas about tech-nology markets that made his previous books bestsellers, combined with the work of Paul Johnson, a top Wall Street technology analyst, and Tom Kippola, a high-tech consul-tant and highly successful private investor.

Personal wealth is only a gorilla game away.</p></p><p>Finding the next Microsoft has been the Holy Grail for many investors. However, anyone who has dabbled in technology stocks can't help but be dismayed at their extreme volatility--it's not unusual for tech stocks to gain or lose 10 to 20 percent in a single day. So how can you win in this market and find the next Cisco, Intel, or Oracle? The key to winning, says bestselling author Geoffrey Moore, is to play the "gorilla game."<p> Moore's previous two books, <i>Crossing the Chasm</i> and <i>Inside the Tornado</i>, are the bibles for many marketing professionals and product managers. In these books, Moore describes the life cycle common to the successful adoption of technology products and pinpoints moments in the cycle, for example, "the chasm," the "bowling alley," and the "tornado," where products can either flourish or fade away. In <i>The Gorilla Game</i>, Moore takes these concepts, with the help of coauthors Paul Johnson and Tom Kippola, and applies them to the task of finding gorilla stocks--ones that dominate their market niches. The book looks at how the market values technology stocks and provides case studies of markets where gorillas have been born. Moore and his coauthors put their ideas to the test in the final chapter and pick a portfolio of stocks that they believe have the potential to become winners in the gorilla game. The result is a highly perceptive investment guide that anyone who's a fan of Moore's earlier work will find exciting and profitable. This revised edition, published a year and a half after the first, includes a new chapter on valuing Internet stocks. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i></p><p>Geoffrey A.

Good value for the bookshelf.&#x201d; &#x2014;Aero Modeller Magazine</p><p>Don Ross, a private pilot and engineer, started building model airplanes in 1942 when he volunteered to help with the US Navy&#x2019;s &#x201c;Spotter Model Program.&#x201d; The idea was to construct carefully carved solid pine models of enemy aircraft that were then painted black. After being checked for accuracy by a Navy representative who came to the schools, the models were sent to the Navy to be mounted in the wardrooms of Navy ships to help sailors and airmen quickly identify enemy aircraft. Don worked in the aircraft and instrument industries and eventually ran a company that made nameplates, dials, and other marked items for various industries. His business was known as a &#x201c;short run&#x201d; company, specializing in small orders needed in a hurry. Since he wrote all the job sheets for the shop, he became quite practiced at explaining complicated operations to a work force that spoke several languages. Don designed the rubber powered &#x201c;Canarsie Canary&#x201d; for beginners, of which thousands were built and successfully flown by rank beginners, and it became an immensely popular project for clubs and scout groups. A video titled &#x201c;Silent Magic&#x201d; shows how a group of 20 eleven-years-olds built and flew the &#x201c;Canary&#x201d; in a large indoor venue. Most of the models flew for 25-30 seconds, exciting spectators as well as the kids. In 2003 The National Free Flight Society chose the &#x201c;Canary&#x201d; as its &#x201c;Beginner&#x2019;s Model of the Year.&#x201d; Don&#x2019;s &#x201c;Fledgling&#x201d; classes have added scores of young and &#x201c;retread&#x201d; modelers to the active scene.

But now General Bellorum is back, along with his bloodthirsty spawn--twin sons even more vicious than him. Thirrin and Oskan also have a family: two girls and three boys. But darkness lurks within the House of Lindenshield: Medea, the couple's cold-hearted fifteen-year-old daughter, is just coming into her magical powers, and she may be the downfall of the kingdom. It's up to her brother, Charlemagne, crippled by polio as a child, to return from exile and rescue the land he loves.</p><p>Stuart Hill was born in Leicester, in the East Midlands, where he still lives. He has worked as a car trimmer, a cemetery gardener, a teacher, archaeologist and bookseller. He now writes full-time. The Cry of the Icemark was his first novel for children.Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;In this story set 20 years after <i>The Cry of the Icemark</i> (Scholastic, 2005), Queen Thirrin and Oskan Witchfather now have five grown children who make up the royal House of Lindenshield. The book mainly focuses on Charlemagne, their youngest child. His greatest desire is to be a warrior and to defend his kingdom like all of the other members in his family. Unfortunately, he suffers from a physical ailment as a result of polio, which prevents him from satisfying his dream. To make matters worse, war has been waged between Icemark and its chronic nemesis Scipio Bellorum. Charlemagne is exiled for protection but leaves with the mystical promise that he will save Icemark from ultimate destruction. At the same time, his 15-year-old sister, Medea, begins using her magical powers to side with the enemy. What results is a typical high-fantasy novel complete with epic battles and a fight between good and evil. The characters contain little depth, and their actions are predictable despite situations that lend themselves to vast, creative transformations. Although fans of the first book may find pleasure in learning more about Queen Thirrin, this novel does not stand alone, often succumbing to trite plotlines and slow pacing. Readers of fantasy are more apt to enjoy Cornelia Funke's <i>Inkheart</i> (Scholastic, 2003) or one of the other novels from the increasingly abundant genre.&#x2014;<i>Marie C.

Perhaps the most famous Roman ever, Gaius Julius Caesar created a legacy which has resonated, for good or ill, throughout Western culture. Architect of an imperial system, eponymous sponsor of a reformed calendar system, orator second only to Cicero, conqueror of Gaul: Surely those accomplishments in the diverse fields of politics, applied mathematics, rhetoric, and military science would justify his eminence. Nevertheless, the high literary quality and historical value of this seemingly modest account match its exciting story of diplomatic maneuverings, shifting alliances, and military actions; the final chapters culminate in the revolt of the united Gallic tribes under Vercingetorix, France's first national hero, and are as compelling as any contemporary spy thriller. </strong></p><p><i>Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres...</i> It is, perhaps, the most famous opening line of any memoir in Western civilization. What Caesar and the Romans called "Gaul," although we usually think of it as France, also comprised Belgium, the German lands west of the Rhine, southern Holland, and much of Switzerland. This is the only military campaign of the ancient world for which we have a chronicle written by the general who conducted it, and Julius Caesar is an insightful historian, with a keen eye for detail, as in this scene from the repulsion of the forces of the German king Ariovistus: <blockquote>Caesar placed each of his five generals ahead of a legion and detailed his quaestor to command the remaining legion, so that every soldier might know that there was a high officer in a position to observe the courage with which he conducted himself, and then led the right wing first into action, because he had noticed that the enemy's line was weakest on that side.</blockquote><p><strong>Julius Caesar was born in 100 BCE to a distinguished, although not politically prominent, patrician family. During his praetorship (62 BCE) and consulship (59 BCE) Caesar espoused positions and causes which excited great passion. He generated the military forces and political clout which made him, first, a conqueror of the territory from Northern Italy to the far side of the English Channel, then a contender for world dominion in 49 BCE.</strong></p></p><h2>Everybody Loves a Good Drought</h2><p>The poor in India are, too often, reduced to statistics. In the dry language of development reports and economic projections, the true misery of the 312 million who live below the poverty line, or the 26 million displaced by various projects, or the 13 million who suffer from tuberculosis gets overlooked. In this thoroughly researched study of the poorest of the poor, we get to see how they manage, what sustains them, and the efforts, often ludicrous, to do something for them. The people who figure in this book typify the lives and aspirations of a large section of Indian society, and their stories present us with the true face of development.</p><p>Palagummi Sainath is a renowned Mumbai-based freelance journalist.

And that was the service that Andrew Rusk had found a way to provide. Like any quality product, it did not come cheap. Nor did it come quickly. And perhaps most important of all, it was not for those with weak constitutions. Demand was high, of course, but few people were truly suitable clients. It took a deep-rooted hatred to watch your spouse die in agony, knowing that you had brought about that pain. But on the other hand, some people bore up remarkably well." <br><br> With these words, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Greg Iles returns to his trademark Southern milieu in this terrifying thriller, an unnerving tale of evil lurking beneath the veneer of idyllic suburban life. Brimming with the masterful suspense and intense psychological drama that made Turning Angel, Blood Memory, and The Quiet Game bestsellers, True Evil tells the chilling story of a divorce attorney who may be orchestrating the deaths of his clients' spouses, bringing new meaning to the phrase "'til death do us part." <br> <br> Dr. Chris Shepard is thirty-six years old, newly married, and well on his way to a perfect life. Or so he believes. But that future is forever cast into doubt the day Special Agent Alexandra Morse walks into his office and drops a bombshell: Dr. Shepard's beautiful new wife is plotting his murder. Shepard is so shocked that he almost throws Agent Morse out of his office. Yet once he is alone, doubt begins to gnaw at him. Paranoia magnifies the small cracks in his marital relationship, and soon he can have no peace unless he knows the truth. When Agent Morse reappears, Chris agrees to act as bait to help her unravel the divorce lawyer's scheme, which may already have cost nine unsuspecting spouses their lives. <br> <br> At the center of the mystery lies a maddeningly simple question: If these people really were murdered, why can't the FBI prove it? Rigorous autopsies have uncovered no forensic evidence of foul play, and the police believe no crimes have occurred. As Dr. Shepard and Agent Morse struggle against an invisible adversary, Shepard realizes that he's working with a desperate woman. The reason: the killer's last known victim was Alex Morse's sister, who from her deathbed accused her husband of murder and extracted a vow that Alex save her ten-year-old nephew from his father. This has driven Alex to risk both her life and her career to fulfill that vow. But Chris Shepard soon feels desperation of his own. As he probes his wife's hidden past, he is confronted by the probability that the woman he loves wants him dead. <br> <br> He has adopted her son and given her everything he has to give, and yet somewhere out there, a killer with the brilliance to outwit the top forensic scientists in the world is closing in on him.</p><p>Greg Iles was born in 1960 in Germany, where his father ran the US Embassy medical clinic during the height of the Cold War.

She was a hostage negotiator for the FBI. Twenty minutes earlier, Alex had deplaned from a flight from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Jackson, Mississippi, a flight prompted by her older sister's sudden collapse at a Little League baseball game. This year had been plagued by injury and death, and there was more to come -- Alex could feel it. </p><p> Sighting the elevators, she checked the overhead display and saw that a car was descending. She hit the call button and started bouncing on her toes. <i>Hospitals,</i> she thought bitterly. She'd practically just gotten out of one herself. But the chain of tragedy had started with her father. Five months ago Jim Morse had died in this very hospital, after being shot during a robbery. Two months after that, Alex's mother had been diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer. She had already outlived her prognosis, but wasn't expected to survive the week. Then came Alex's accident. And now Grace -- </p><p> A bell dinged softly, and the elevator opened. </p><p> A young woman wearing a white coat over street clothes leaned against the rear wall in a posture of absolute exhaustion. Intern, Alex guessed. She'd met enough of them during the past month. The woman glanced up as Alex entered the car, then looked down. Then she looked up again. Alex had endured this double take so many times since the shooting that she no longer got angry. Just depressed. </p><p> "What floor?" asked the young woman, raising her hand to the panel and trying hard not to stare. </p><p> "Neuro ICU," said Alex, stabbing the 4 with her finger. </p><p> "I'm going down to the basement," said the intern, who looked maybe twenty-six -- four years younger than Alex. "But it'll take you right up after that." </p><p> Alex nodded, then stood erect and watched the glowing numbers change above her head. After her mother's diagnosis, she'd begun commuting by plane from Washington, D.C. -- where she was based then -- to Mississippi to relieve Grace, who was struggling to teach full-time and also to care for their mother at night. Unlike J. Edgar Hoover's FBI, the modern Bureau tried to be understanding about family problems, but in Alex's case the deputy director had made his position clear: time off to attend a funeral was one thing, regularly commuting a thousand miles to be present for chemotherapy was another. But Alex had not listened. She'd bucked the system and learned to live without sleep. She told herself she could hack the pressure, and she did -- right up until the moment she cracked. The problem was, she hadn't realized she'd cracked until she caught part of a shotgun blast in her right shoulder and face. Her vest had protected the shoulder, but her face was still an open question. </p><p> For a hostage negotiator, Alex had committed the ultimate sin, and she'd come close to paying the ultimate price. Because the shooter had fired through a plate-glass partition, what would have been a miraculous escape (being grazed by a couple of pellets that could have blown her brains out but hadn't) became a life-altering trauma. A blizzard of glass tore through her cheek, sinuses, and jaw, lacerating her skin and ripping away tissue and bone. The plastic surgeons had promised great things, but so far the results were less than stellar. They'd told her that in time the angry pink worms would whiten (they could do little to repair the "punctate" depressions in her cheek), and that laymen wouldn't even notice the damage. Alex wasn't convinced. But in the grand scheme of things, what did vanity matter? Five seconds after she was shot, someone else had paid the ultimate price for her mistake. </p><p> During the hellish days that followed the shooting, Grace had flown up to D.C. three times to be with Alex, despite being exhausted from taking care of their mother. Grace was the family martyr, a genuine candidate for sainthood. The irony was staggering: tonight it was Grace lying in an intensive care unit, fighting for her life. </p><p> And why? Certainly not karma. She'd been walking up the steps of a stadium to watch her ten-year-old son play baseball when she collapsed. Seconds after she hit the stairs, she voided her bladder and bowels. A CAT scan taken forty minutes later showed a blood clot near Grace's brain stem, the kind of clot that too often killed people. Alex had been swimming laps in Charlotte when she got word (having been transferred there as punishment duty after the shooting). Her mother was too upset to be coherent on the phone, but she'd communicated enough details to send Alex racing to the airport. </p><p> When the first leg of her flight touched down in Atlanta, Alex had used her Treo to call Grace's husband, whom she'd been unable to reach before boarding the plane. Bill Fennell explained that while the neurological damage had initially not looked too bad -- some right-side paralysis, weakness, mild dysphasia -- the stroke seemed to be worsening, which the doctors said was not uncommon. A neurologist had put Grace on TPA, a drug that could dissolve clots but also carried serious risks of its own. Bill Fennell was a commanding man, but his voice quavered as he related this, and he begged Alex to hurry. </p><p> When her plane landed in Jackson, Alex called Bill again. This time he sobbed as he related the events of the past hour. Though still breathing on her own, Grace had lapsed into a coma and might die before Alex could cover the fifteen miles from the airport. A panic unlike any she had known since childhood filled her chest. Though the plane had only begun its taxi to the terminal, Alex snatched her carry-on from beneath the seat and marched to the front of the 727. When a flight attendant challenged her, she flashed her FBI creds and quietly told the man to get her to the terminal ASAP. When she cleared the gate, she sprinted down the concourse and through baggage claim, then jumped the cab queue, flashed her creds again, and told the driver she'd give him $100 to drive a hundred miles an hour to the University Medical Center. </p><p> Now here she was, stepping out of the elevator on the fourth floor, sucking in astringent smells that hurled her four weeks back in time, when hot blood had poured from her face as though from a spigot. At the end of the corridor waited a huge wooden door marked neurology icu. She went through it like a first-time parachutist leaping from a plane, steeling herself for free fall, terrified of the words she was almost certain to hear: <i>I'm sorry, Alex, but you're too late.</i> </p><p> The ICU held a dozen glass-walled cubicles built in a U-shape around the nurses' station. Several cubicles were curtained off, but through the transparent wall of the fourth from the left, Alex saw Bill Fennell talking to a woman in a white coat. At six feet four, Bill towered over her, but his handsome face was furrowed with anxiety, and the woman seemed to be comforting him. Sensing Alex's presence, he looked up and froze in midsentence. Alex moved toward the cubicle. Bill rushed to the door and hugged her to his chest. She'd always felt awkward embracing her brother-in-law, but tonight there was no way to avoid it. And no reason, really. Tonight they both needed some kind of contact, an affirmation of family unity. </p><p> "You must have taken a helicopter," he said in his resonant bass voice. "I can't believe you made it that fast." </p><p> "Is she alive?" </p><p> "She's still with us," Bill said in a strangely formal tone. "She's actually regained consciousness a couple of times. She's been asking for you." </p><p> Alex's heart lifted, but with hope came fresh tears. </p><p> The woman in the white coat walked out of the cubicle. She looked about fifty, and her face was kind but grave. </p><p> "This is Grace's neurologist," Bill said. </p><p> "I'm Meredith Andrews," said the woman. "Are you the one Grace calls KK?" </p><p> Alex couldn't stop her tears. KK was a nickname derived from her middle name, which was a family appellation: Karoli. "Yes. But please call me Alex. Alex Morse." </p><p> "Special Agent Morse," Bill said in an absurd interjection. </p><p> "Has Grace asked for me?" Alex asked, wiping her cheeks. </p><p> "You're all she can talk about." </p><p> "Is she conscious?" </p><p> "Not at this moment. We're doing everything we can, but you should prepare yourself for" -- Dr. Andrews gave Alex a lightning-fast appraisal -- "you should prepare for the worst. Grace had a serious thrombosis when she was brought in, but she was breathing on her own, and I was encouraged. But the stroke extended steadily, and I decided to start thrombolytic therapy. To try to dissolve the clot. This can sometimes produce miracles, but it can also cause hemorrhages elsewhere in the brain or body. I have a feeling that may be happening now. I don't want to risk moving Grace for an MRI. She's still breathing on her own, and that's the best hope we have. If she stops breathing, we're ready to intubate immediately. I probably should have done it already" -- Dr. Andrews glanced at Bill -- "but I knew she was desperate to talk to you, and once she's intubated, she won't be able to communicate with anyone. She's already lost her ability to write words." </p><p> Alex winced. </p><p> "Don't be shocked if she manages to speak to you. Her speech center has been affected, and she has significant impairment." </p><p> "I understand," Alex said impatiently. "We had an uncle who had a stroke. Can I just be with her? I don't care what her condition is. I have to be with her." </p><p> Dr. Andrews smiled and led Alex into the room. </p><p> As she reached the door, Alex turned back to Bill. "Where's Jamie?" </p><p> "With my sister in Ridgeland." </p><p> Ridgeland was a white-flight suburb ten miles away. "Did he see Grace fall?" </p><p> Bill shook his head somberly. "No, he was down on the field. He just knows his mother's sick, that's all." </p><p> "Don't you think he should be here?" </p><p> Alex had tried to keep all judgment out of her voice, but Bill's face darkened. He seemed about to snap at her, but then he drew a deep breath and said, "No, I don't." </p><p> When Ale...</p></p><h2>The Medical Book</h2><p>The Medical Book</p><p></p><h2>The Tall Book of Mother Goose</h2><p>The most popular and best loved rhymes of Mother Goose presented for the very young</p><p></p><h2>Richard Scarry&#39;s Cars and Trucks</h2><p>Beep, beep!

In fact, even though I was a full-time employee of a large evangelical church in the Chicago suburbs, I was pretty sure I didn&#x2019;t believe in Christianity anymore. Somewhere along the line, between being saved in elementary school and joining the staff at a church, my faith had stopped working. Like a car with a seized engine or an air conditioner that blows only warm air, my life as a Christian had run its course. An observer might see all the right pieces there, but something was uncomfortably absent.<br><br>For years I thought Christianity was fundamentally about three things: believing the correct things about God, saying a magic prayer to obtain eternal security, and not doing any of the fun things your friends are doing. It felt like growing up in a small pond that was perfectly safe for beginning swimmers. But once you grew a bit, you began stubbing your toes in the shallows and dreaming about oceans.<br><br>I was raised in the Plymouth Brethren faith tradition, a &#x201c;conservative, low church, nonconformist, evangelical Christian movement whose history can be traced to Dublin, Ireland, in the late 1820s.&#x201d; I experienced it, like any tradition, as a beautiful and messy mixed bag of gifts and disappointments that shaped me deeply. But my overarching reflection is that our church failed to recognize that we were connected to the River of God&#x2019;s kingdom. Instead, we thought we were the one true pond.<br><br>This pond was a beautiful place to begin a faith journey. But as I became aware of the larger church and larger world, I started bumping into other realities and versions of the story that didn&#x2019;t fit neatly into our still waters. I was exposed to different ways that Christians throughout history approached Scripture. I encountered a more Charismatic understanding of the Holy Spirit. I discovered that God was not an American&#x2014;and not even a Republican. I learned that faith and science were not opposites. I got to know Catholics and was scandalized to discover that they, too, were Christians.<br><br>This was an exciting yet destabilizing season. I was thrown off balance because my early Christian training convinced me that anything outside our small pond of Plymouth Brethren beliefs and traditions was wrong. We were the center, and everything else was judged as off center. Instead of teaching us to be curious, they taught us to critique. Instead of teaching us to learn from other people of faith, they taught us to protect ourselves from being led astray. Instead of helping us discern and sift the wheat from the chaff, they trained us to defend ourselves against <i> anything</i> that fell outside our circle.<br><br>I wish my early tradition would have seen my search and said, &#x201c;Yes! Keep exploring! Go! We&#x2019;ve given you a foundation. Now let it sweep you into the bigger River. Keep growing and learning and building.&#x201d; Instead, church leaders inadvertently communicated, <i>Nope. We are right; they are wrong. We are inside and have all the rightness; they are outside with none of the rightness. Stay with us or fall away from the faith.<br><br></i>So for the first twenty-five years of my life, I stayed in the small pond. I wanted to be a good Christian. I loved the people in this faith community, and they loved me. But eventually, from the inside out, my faith began to crumble. And I found myself at the crossroads that so many other people have stood at: Should I double down on a faith that no longer works or abandon the whole thing?</p><p>Maybe you have asked this question. Maybe you&#x2019;re asking it right now. Your pond may feel very different from mine, but the ache for more is universal. No matter how good and whole your experience has been, the River is deeper. The Current is stronger. And you were made to get swept up into the fullness of its flowing goodness. Could this be your moment?</p><p>Increasingly in the polarized time we find ourselves, it can feel as if we have only two choices: give in or give up. We can turn off our hearts to stay where we are, or we can break our hearts by walking away from faith entirely. Friends, these are terrible choices. And thankfully, they are not the only options. But I know firsthand the claustrophobic pain of not being able to identify a third way.</p><p>So there I was in my midtwenties on a Sunday morning. I was standing backstage at my church, filled with dread as I prepared to put on a fake Christian smile and rock the house once again. Let me state the obvious: it&#x2019;s pretty awkward to urge people to join you in singing songs you no longer believe.</p><p>This season of losing faith was dark. I didn&#x2019;t feel angry as much as sad&#x2014;and profoundly lost. Very quickly I slipped into a numb sort of despair.</p><p>Most often, the despair came out sideways. My disillusionment with faith spread to a disillusionment with just about everything and everyone else. Rather than grappling with the terror of feeling the ground disintegrating beneath my feet, I mostly just poked holes in everything else. Everyone was stupid. Everyone was fake. Everything was a lie. This was essentially a matter of self-protection. If I could remain focused on how everyone was wrong, I wouldn&#x2019;t have to wrestle with the terrifying reality of my own wrongness. But in quiet moments, the unwelcome whispers of the faith I had lost sneaked through my cynic&#x2019;s armor, and in those undefended moments, I felt truly defenseless.</p><p>The Christian story was the wallpaper on nearly every room of my memory&#x2014;framing every day of my life. I didn&#x2019;t know how to move forward constructively without it.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not the only person who has felt that <i>giving in </i> or<i> giving up</i> were his or her only options. I needed to find a third way, and I have a hunch that if you&#x2019;re with me this far, you&#x2019;re looking for a third way as well. Jesus called it the narrow road that leads to life (see Matthew 7:14).</p><p>You will never settle for a small version of the story, but you&#x2019;re not willing to give up altogether. Thank God. Or maybe you have found a third way and are looking to move more deeply into these streams. In either case, it&#x2019;s possible to take a new path. But it&#x2019;s very difficult to take the path alone.<br><br></p><p><b>A New Way Forward</b></p><p>Thankfully, my parents and a few close friends weren&#x2019;t afraid of the doubts and questions of my midtwenties. In fact, a few of them moved closer to me in my dark season. (This is not normal. Many people express their doubts, only to get kicked out of the community. I am profoundly grateful for such a loving family and for safe, patient, and wise friends.)</p><p>A friend named Chris&#x2014;a musician in my band who would go on to become a brilliant theologian&#x2014;gave me a life-altering book. Possibly without realizing it, he was saying, <i>You&#x2019;ve been trapped in one small pond for a long time, and you&#x2019;re drowning. But there&#x2019;s a bigger and better River out there! Here&#x2019;s an invitation into an entirely new way of being.</i> Chris handed me a copy of <i>The Divine Conspiracy</i> by Dallas Willard.</p><p>I remember the morning I read chapter 2, &#x201c;Gospels of Sin Management.&#x201d; I was sitting on a fake-wood floor, leaning against a fake-leather couch, when God used Willard&#x2019;s writing to open my eyes to a reality that I had never before heard: the kingdom of God. I learned that Jesus was inviting us not primarily into correct beliefs, eternal destinations, or behavior modification but rather to participate in a living, eternally present reality. Through Christ, we get to join the redemption and restoration of all things. God has not given up on the world. Instead, God invites every one of us&#x2014;in the way of Jesus and through the power of the Spirit&#x2014;into the divine conspiracy of overcoming evil with good.</p><p>Although I had been a Christian most of my life, this was the first time I had heard teaching on the subject that Jesus devoted most of <i>his </i>teaching to. Jesus&#x2019;s primary message in the Gospels is the kingdom of God, but for some reason my tradition had avoided the topic entirely. How could we have missed Jesus&#x2019;s core message?</p><p>At first I felt regret and frustration, but these quickly melted into gratitude for the possibility of a new way forward. This is such good news!</p><p>As my heart pounded and my vision blurred with tears, I sat on the floor where I had been reading and prayed over and over, &#x201c;God, if this is what you are up to in the world, I&#x2019;m in. If this is who you are and what you care about, I&#x2019;m in. God, if you can use someone like me, in all my doubt and brokenness, I&#x2019;m in.&#x201d;</p><p>And like a good evangelical, I was born again...again.<br><br></p><p><b>Learning to Swim</b></p><p>The first few months after being awakened to God&#x2019;s kingdom were full of passion, gratitude, and almost-nuclear energy. Like discovering a treasure buried in my backyard, I had found what was missing, and I threw my whole self into trying to live it out. But while the conversion exuberance carried me for a while, I began to notice that my old tools were no longer fit for this new journey. The skills I relied on to swim in the still pond didn&#x2019;t help me in the raging River. The old wineskins were never meant to hold new wine.</p><p>I had finally been drawn into the great Eternal Current that has been flowing throughout history, and I wholeheartedly said yes to Christ&#x2019;s invitation to get into the water. But I didn&#x2019;t know how to swim. I didn&#x2019;t know what to do on Sundays or in my life. My mind had been converted, and my heart was burning with devotion, but I didn&#x2019;t know how to live into it.</p><p>So I began exploring.</p><p>The years following my spiritual awakening were both glorious and tumultuous, exciting and disillusioning, heart expanding and heartbreaking. The search led me more deeply into myself, and it nudged me outward into corners of the Christian faith that previously would have felt dangerously off limits. My heart had been seized by the mighty River of grace that is good news to all people, and I was going to either learn how to swim with Christ or drown trying.<br><br></p><p><b>Worship Beyond Singing</b></p><p>This search led my wife, Shauna, and me to Michigan, where we joined with a young pastor named Rob Bell at his church, Mars Hill Bible Church. Our years at Mars Hill were some of the most exciting and stretching of my whole life. It was a greenhouse for artistic experimentation, theological exploration, and discovering what the kingdom of God could look like in an actual time and place. We read books that blew our minds, heard sermons that ignited our hearts, and walked closely with a small group of Jesus followers who will forever frame the way we think about community.</p><p>As a worship leader, I tried to align the Mars Hill community with the bigger story, but I quickly discovered that my normal approach was woefully inadequate. Four rock songs and a hymn fell far short of the depth and width of the kingdom vision that animated us. It was like trying to paint Van Gogh&#x2019;s <i>The Starry Night</i> masterpiece using only two colors. And so we began to experiment with different forms, practices, and ways to worship. Fortunately, my ministry partner, Troy Hatfield, had been on this journey for many years. He had a huge influence on all that we learned and discovered.</p><p>In the same way that God expanded our corporate worship forms to embrace the bigger story, God did the same thing in my soul. Four rock songs and a hymn no longer cut it on Sundays, and my personal spiritual practice began to fall short as well. It was in this season that I heard about contemplative Christianity, and I practiced centering prayer for the first time. I learned about the Jewish roots of our faith and began to see the Scriptures in a new and more vibrant light. Rob Bell&#x2019;s teaching also exposed me to the deep connection between spiritual health and emotional health, and we explored practices that helped us become not just better Christians but, I hoped, better humans.</p><p>As my internal world was being reshaped and reformed, I learned that God was inviting me outward into the bigger world that God was reshaping and reforming. I didn&#x2019;t always live it out well, but this season was the first time I saw contemplation and activism come together in one community. The deeper we went inside ourselves, the more we felt propelled into the messiness of the world. We didn&#x2019;t have to choose between being exhausted activists and being isolated contemplatives. Instead, we caught a vision for swimming with Christ in a life of contemplative activism. I will always be grateful for Rob and the Mars Hill family.</p><p>In these formative years, both as individuals and as part of a church community, Shauna and I discovered that God&#x2019;s Eternal Current is deeper and grander and more beautifully powerful than we knew. This understanding brought us face to face with our inability to swim well in it. Four songs and a hymn in worship could get our feet wet, but we had to move beyond singing if we were to enter the flow and swim. My personal practice of reading the Bible and journaling was a helpful foundation, but it could take me only so far. Thankfully, God&#x2019;s grace drenched us as we stumbled and splashed around with new (old) practices and worship forms. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to see what was around the corner.</p></p><h2>The Complete Book of Tarot: A Step-By-Step Guide to Reading the Cards</h2><p>Tarot cards are like mirrors that reflect unsuspected knowledge buried deep in the unconscious mind.

The one introduction we had been given was addressed to Manfred Whitaker, who lived in the Villa Ingham just outside Marsala. Instructions as to how we could find him were hazy in the extreme. Indeed, there was something slightly makeshift about the introduction itself, but we felt that we had better call in out of courtesy, if nothing else, and so we did.Manfred turned out to be a stocky, energetic figure, and vigorously, if not rampantly, homosexual. When he saw two strapping lads getting out of their hire car he evidently thought that Christmas had come, a point on which we had to disabuse him rapidly. With the foreplay out of the way, he became the most delightful, charming and obliging of hosts, learned, funny, acerbic and individual. Sadly, I kept no record of his views or our conversations, but I can still sense the mercurial force of his personality, his endless kindness and high good humour.I remember being told, probably by Manfred himself, that the Villa Ingham had been built, and its extensive gardens laid out, by a member of the wealthy Ingham family for the delight of his mistress. It didn&#x2019;t look like my idea of a love nest. It remained in my memory as a large, sober-looking building with an apparently endless sequence of crepuscular rooms, full of shadows and cool air and an accumulation of heavy-gravity, dark-shaded, plumply stuffed Victorian furniture, books, portraits of distinguished ancestors and a random and eccentric cluster of objects, which included a standard lamp made from a stuffed anaconda rearing to its full height. There was Manfred&#x2019;s throne-like lavatory and the plumbing that had a will of its own. It didn&#x2019;t strike me as being a grand house, but it did have a certain seriousness about it, a seriousness which Manfred belied.He died in 1977 and the house passed to his nephew, William Richards, and his wife Val, who greeted me as I buzzed up the drive in time for lunch. William was a lawyer, successful, jovial, kindly and generous. The Villa Ingham was now a family holiday home, he said. They had thought of selling it at first; it needed so much attention, and Marsala wasn&#x2019;t exactly convenient. And then they decided they couldn&#x2019;t. The family loved it too much. Their children came and went, and other family members, too. And yes, they had done a good deal to the house, attended to the plumbing for one thing, and sorted out the kitchen, and turned the water tank above the house into a swimming pool.I wandered around the rooms and couldn&#x2019;t tell what had changed over the intervening years. The furniture seemed the same, the books, the steadfast pictures, the clutter of knick-knacks, and, oh yes, there was the anaconda standard lamp. More than that, the spirit of the place was still the same, that curious combination of the serious and the fantastical, of Victorian worthiness and pagan hedonism, one room leading to the next and to the next and to the next &#x2013; like some Borgesian metaphysical structure, the crepuscular cool made more crepuscular and cooler in contrast to the brilliantly lit landscape below, where olive and orange trees had been planted in neat rectangular plantations. I didn&#x2019;t remember the paintings in the manner of Rex Whistler on the high ceiling in the sitting room, and, indeed, it turned out they had been painted by a young friend of the family only a few years earlier, but even they had been absorbed into the patina of the house so that they looked as if they had always been there.The garden, too, retained its rambling charm. It had seemed deliciously dilapidated to me 33 years earlier. It did so now. Paths, strewn with withered leaves that crackled explosively underfoot, wove their way between trees and shrubs of luxurious splendour, to crumbling flights of steps leading to another sun and shadow dappled level. Scents rose up where the hot sun struck the shrubs, peppery, pungent, spicy, herbal; thyme, rosemary, clove, aniseed.Here was a statue of some antique dryad lurking at the end of a gravel cul-de-sac, peering from a bower of acanthus leaves. Here was a stone trough with lily pads and reflections. Here was a water tank without any water, a line of curious majolica miniature obelisks the colour of the sky ranged along the top of one side. A scuttling in the bushes reminded me of the peacocks that had nested in the trees all those years ago.&#x2018;The peacocks are still here,&#x2019; said William. &#x2018;There are only two left now, both males. We introduced a couple of females a few years ago in the hope they might breed, but we found them dead a few days later. It seems that the males didn&#x2019;t appreciate them very much.&#x2019; I wondered what might have happened if Adam had taken a similar attitude to Eve in the Garden of Eden.The sense of timelessness, of social continuum, carried over into lunch. There were other friends and members of the family staying, too, just as there had been in Manfred&#x2019;s time, and we sat outside at a table big enough to seat 20 under an awning, shaded from the hot sun. There were only nine of us, but conversation, erudite, funny, discursive, generous, never flagged for a moment. We talked about food and TV chefs in disrespectful terms that Manfred would have approved of, and George Borrow, and the problems of photographing food, and the group of Surrey pensioners who came to pick the olives every year, and Manfred&#x2019;s idiosyncrasies, and the changes at the Villa Ingham. If I wasn&#x2019;t quite same figure who had sat in this same place all those years ago, nevertheless there was enough of my young self left to catch the sweet echo of the past.We ate <i>panelle,</i> Sicilian fritters made from chickpea flour, bought in the market that morning, and olives from the Richards&#x2019; olive trees, and then salami and prosciutto and salad and bread and cheese and fruit, and finished with a granita made from oranges that grew on the estate. There was nothing fancy about any of it, except its quality, the exactness and clarity of flavours. &#x2018;What else did you want?&#x2019; I thought, as I sank another glass of chilled <i>rosato</i>, crisp and fresh as ice melt. Not much. Nothing in fact.Revisiting the past can be a tricky business. Too often it seems shrunken or down at heel or at odds with the mellowness of memory, but in this case I could feel no difference between past and present. Even Manfred seemed to be about the place, even if I couldn&#x2019;t quite see him.<br>I woke to the smell of the sea, a soup of sharp iodine, seaweed, salt, marine life, sunlight, wind. Marsala is defined by the sea. The sea sits on three sides of it. From the sea came the Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Spaniards, British, Americans, each of the peoples that made and marked it, the fish and trade that fed it. Across the sea went the wine that gave Marsala its last great, rich incarnation a hundred and fifty years ago.In 1773 John Woodhouse came to Marsala from Liverpool looking for ingredients for soap. He found the fortified local hooch instead, and decided marsala was the very thing to become smart society&#x2019;s tipple of choice. The business was given a shot in the arm when Admiral Horatio Nelson ordered several pipes of the stuff for his sailors after the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Over the following century colossal fortunes were made out of the wine. The English connection flourished as the Woodhouse family embraced the Inghams and the Whitakers, the &#x2018;Princes under the Volcano&#x2019; as the marsala families were known. Sicilian families, too, joined in the fun, one family in particular, the Florios, becoming the richest and grandest of them all. Each went on to make marked contributions to the cultural life of the island and to the gaiety of nations in general (during Prohibition in America, marsala was classified as a medicinal tonic, and sold as such).And then the eminence of marsala began to decline as the founding families sold out to the big commercial battalions; the wine became debased as corners were cut, quality sacrificed to price, and industrial production methods took their toll. As Harry Morley, a determined traveller and devoted classicist, had written as early as 1926: &#x2018;The only good thing you can say about Marsala is that it goes well with gorgonzola. At best it is a poor substitute for sherry or madeira, without any real character of its own.&#x2019; The consequences were inevitable. People stopped drinking marsala. Ah, marsala, they said, fine for cooking, but for sipping? And they reached for their glasses of chardonnay.The long seafront of the town was lined with the husks of the great bagli, walled, fortified compounds, where the marsala had once been made and stored, and from which it had been shipped across the globe &#x2014; monuments now to the fall of the great marsala families. Most were derelict, dumping grounds or storage depots for building materials and the like. Dust and plastic bags and bits of paper and dead leaves blew about the courtyards. The three-storey Whitaker <i>baglio</i> had been one of the greatest, with its shaded, arcaded ground floor, Corinthian pillars above, and elegant, shuttered windows on the top floor. Now the golden stucco was fading, stonework crumbling. The shutters sagged on their hinges and the Corinthian pillars held up &#x2013; what? A vanished history? Not quite.Life was beginning to stir in the some of the <i>bagli</i> once more. Marsala was staging a comeback. Its renaissance had begun when a talented winemaker, Marco de Bortoli, decided that redemption lay in quality not quantity, and set about re-creating the wine to new standards. The Buffa family, with one or two others, had joined him, and, little by little, marsala&#x2019;s reputation was improving. What was it Edward Lear had written?<br><i>He sits in a beautiful parlour</i> <br><i>With hundreds of books on the wall;</i> <br><i>He drinks a great deal of Marsala,</i> <br><i>But never gets tipsy at all.</i><br>Lear can never have come across the Buffa marsala, that&#x2019;s all I can say.As I said goodbye to Domenico Buffa, a stiff wind stirred up the dust in the courtyard of the <i>baglio.</i> Sharp waves flicked the scrubby coastline on to which the building faced, and against the hulls of leisure craft in the marina, against the jetties, against the hulls of the fishing boats &#x2013; smaller, multicoloured inshore boats; larger, grubbier, more purposeful deep-water boats with names like <i>Turridu, Carmelo</i> and <i>Pinturicchio &#x2014;</i> moored within the long sheltering arm of the mole that formed the harbour wall.I found their harvest in the compact, cruciform fish market just by the Porta Garibaldi, the gate through which Garibaldi entered the town in May 1860 to begin his conquest of the island and start the process that led, with extraordinary rapidity, to the unification of Italy within two years. The Porta Garibaldi was not always the Porta Garibaldi. It had formerly been the Porta di Mare, but history has always marched through and over Marsala. It had been Lilybeaum to the Carthaginians and Marsa Ali, the Port of Allah, to the Saracens. The gate had been built to mimic a Roman triumphal arch. The eagle on it was the emblem of Spanish royalty, from the time when Sicily was part of the Spanish Empire. But the fish and the fishermen have always been there.The market may not have been as vigorous as it was once, to judge by the areas not occupied by stalls, but it still supported 15 or so fishmongers, three greengrocers and a <i>salumeria</i> where I could have bought <i>bottarga</i> and <i>strattu,</i> ultra concentrated tomato paste, pecorino and salted anchovies in great round tins. There were a couple of butchers, too, decked out with skinned sheep&#x2019;s heads that peered with bloody melancholy from the display cabinets.It was spring &#x2013; this was May &#x2013; and the sloping display counters were crowded with cephalopods: octopuses in four sizes; tiny <i>moscardini</i> like dominoes; squid, flaccid and startlingly white; plump, speckled cuttlefish; and fish &#x2013; whiting, hake, bream, anchovies, dogfish, gurnard, sea bass in all their shimmering, glittering, scaly glory. Above all, this was the season for <i>pesce spada &#x2014;</i> swordfish &#x2013; with the world&#x2019;s smallest specimen on display, its bill pointing skywards; and for tuna. Each stall had its display, gunmetal skin, round surprised eye in head shaped like a howitzer shell, barrel torso slashed in half presenting a lambent, burgundy surface to the world. And in front six, seven, eight different cuts, ranging in colour from coral pink to a deep, purplish damask.According to Alan Davidson in his encyclopaedic classic <i>Mediterranean Seafood</i>, there are several members of the tuna family: bluefin &#x2013; <i>tonno</i>; albacore <i>&#x2014;alalonga;</i> little tuna&#x2014; <i>tonnetto</i>; skipjack &#x2013; <i>tonnetto listato;</i> and frigate mackerel &#x2013; <i>tombarello.</i> Of these, the bluefin tuna, the largest, is the most highly prized.Traditionally these were taken at the <i>mattanza,</i> the annual ritual in which migrating tuna were herded into nets and then gaffed and slaughtered in a bloody frenzy, just off Favignana, one of the Egadi islands visible from Marsala. The ritual is as old as history. Aeschylus likened the slaughter of the Persians at the Battle of Salamis to the <i>mattanza.</i> Modern historians gave the same name to the ferocious Mafia war that raged between 1970 and 1983, which saw the Corleonesi families rise to control the island&#x2019;s criminal activities.The old <i>mattanza</i> still went on, said Salvatore, a large, genial fishmonger with a shaven head and unshaven chin, but it was not what it once was. For all its picturesque brutality, it was, in fact, an environmentally sustainable way to catch fish. More tuna escaped than were taken, and, before more functional modern methods came along, the <i>mattanza</i> ensured a healthy supply of fish for each season. These days the future of the Mediterranean tuna is debated in the same lugubrious tones we use when considering North Sea cod. It is the appetite for this splendid fish in the rest of the world that is threatening its future. Not that there seemed to be any shortage in the market in Marsala.&#x2018;This is good for <i>rag�</i>,&#x2019; explained Salvatore. &#x2018;This for <i>brasato, con cipolle</i> e <i>aceto.</i> This you cook <i>ai ferri,</i> grilled. And this in <i>padella al limone</i>.&#x2019;They all looked much the same to me.&#x2018;And this?&#x2019; I asked, pointing at a piece of tuna the size and thickness of a steak, with thick, creamy seams of fat running between the stratas of purple flesh.<i>&#x2018;Ventresca,&#x2019;</i> he said, and pointed to his ribs. I understood. It&#x2019;s the tuna equivalent of belly of pork, the richest part of the fish. Later I ate a thick steak of <i>ventresca a padella,</i> roasted in a pan, in the Trattoria da Pippo; in a stubby backstreet, it was as functional an eatery as I have come across in some time. But the fish was immaculately cooked, crusted outside, its oily richness spreading over my mouth, its roof, sides, nooks, crannies, coating my tongue and throat &#x2013; a fatness more extreme than mutton, pig or beef fat, but with a bit of beef and lamb about it. This was the true fatness of the sea, the fatness all the sea creatures on which the tuna had been feeding.<br>The Via dei Mille runs from the Porta Garibaldi and the market down to the Piazza della Repubblica, the hub of the town. It was down this road that Garibaldi led his ragtag and bo...</p><h2>Painters and the American West: The Anschutz Collection</h2><p>This richly illustrated book guides us through the finest private collection of art of the American West--the paintings of the Anschutz Collection. The works in the collection reflect every phase in the history of American art since the 1820s and include impressive works by lesser known artists as well as pictures by such masters as Thomas Moran, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Remington, and Georgia O&#39;Keeffe.Published in association with the Denver Art Museum</p><p>This book takes us on a connoisseur&#39;s tour of art of the Old West, guiding us through the Anschutz collection, the finest group of paintings of the American West still in private hands. Joan Carpenter Troccoli looks at these paintings as aesthetic objects rather than historical documents, allowing us to see each work as a self-conscious fashioning of a personal vision and an integral part of mainstream American art.The collection is wide-ranging in scope, covering every phase in the history of American art since the 1820s. There are works from all the major artists who have depicted the West, including those who painted western subjects only occasionally as well as those whose subjects were predominantly western. Among the artists represented are Albert Bierstadt, George Caleb Bingham, George Bellows, Ernest Blumenschein, George Catlin, Stuart Davis, Asher B. Durand, Marsden Hartley, Childe Hassam, George Inness, Thomas Moran, John Marin, Alfred Jacob Miller, Georgia O&#39;Keeffe, Frederic Remington, Charles Russell, and Walter Ufer. The collection is particularly rich in paintings made in Taos and Santa Fe in the first half of the twentieth century, when major American artists often found inspiration and stylistic renewal in the Southwest.This book accompanies an exhibition that opens at the Denver Art Museum in October 2000 and will then travel to the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington D.C., the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, and the Art Institute of Chicago.Joan Carpenter Troccoli is deputy director of the Denver Art Museum and former director of Gilcrease Museum. Philip Anschutz&#39;s daughter, Sarah Anschutz Hunt, has contributed an insightful and valuable memoir about growing up with the collection.</p><h2>How to Stop Time</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A quirky romcom dusted with philosophical observations....A delightfully witty...poignant novel.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;She smiled a soft, troubled smile and I felt the whole world slipping away, and I wanted to slip with it, to go wherever she was going...

Jones started with the ninety poems Thomas selected for his <em>Collected Poems</em> in 1952 (at a time when the poet expected that many years of work still lay ahead of him) and, after exhaustive research and consideration, added one hundred previously finished, though uncollected, poems (including twenty-six juvenile works), and two unfinished poems, and arranged them all in chronological order of composition, creating the most complete edition of Thomas's poems ever published. This revised edition contains all the original material and incorporates textual corrections. Also included are an introduction and concise notes by Daniel Jones, a brief chronology of the poet's life, and a compact disc containing vintage recordings of Thomas reading eight of his poems in his famous "Welsh-singing" style, making this edition of <em>The Poems of Dylan Thomas</em> a truly remarkable collection.</p><p>The reputation of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (1914-1953) as one of the greatest poets of the twentieth century has not waned in the fifty years since his death. His work, noted for its lush metaphors, musicality, and playfulness within traditional forms, was largely responsible for modernizing poetic verse. Thomas also wrote captivating short stories, a novella, several screenplays and radio plays, as well as his delightful stage play, Under Milk Wood&#x2015;all infused with his passion for the English

E. Lee and George Washington; he also edited the Richmond News Leader, made twice-daily radio news broadcasts, and taught journalism at Columbia University.</p></p><p><p>Born in 1886, the son of a Confederate veteran, Douglas Southall Freeman remains one of the greatest historians of the Civil War. His monumental biographies, including Lee's Lieutenants and the Pulitzer Prize-winning R. E. Lee, continue to be popular and valuable reference books for anyone studying that period. </p><p>Freeman's prodigious intellectual energies were not limited to Civil War history. He received a second, posthumous Pulitzer Prize for his six-volume study of George Washington. By employing a strict personal schedule--often rising at 2:30 a.m.--Freeman managed to produce such momentous historical works while also editing a daily newspaper and making twice-daily radio news broadcasts.</p><p>Though a proud and loyal Virginian, Freeman and his influence spread far beyond his native city of Richmond. During Freeman's tenure as editor of the Richmond News Leader from 1915 to 1949, world leaders, like Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower, sought his advice. Throughout World War I, Pres. Woodrow Wilson read Freeman's daily reports about the conflict in Europe. </p><p>Until now, no biography of this important and influential figure has existed. </p><p>Undertaken with the blessing of the Freeman family, this biography represents years of exhaustive research. The author was allowed access to Freeman's copious papers--over 244 boxes in the Library of Congress alone. David Johnson also conducted interviews with many of Freeman's surviving relatives, especially his eldest daughter, Mary Tyler McClenahan, and coworkers, including nationally syndicated columnist James Kilpatrick. The resulting study brings to life the many achievements and diverse talents of Douglas Southall Freeman.</p><p>David E. Johnson serves as senior counsel to the attorney general of Virginia. He was graduated from the College of William and Mary and the T. C. Williams School of Law at the University of Richmond. He lives with his wife, Holly, and their three children in Midlothian, Virginia.</p><p>For information about more books from Pelican's extensive list of Civil War and other historical titles, please visit www.pelicanpub.com</p><p>"David Johnson's even-handed biography of Douglas Southall Freeman exactly limns an extraordinary man. The Doc, as we newsmen knew him, would be pleased."<br>--James J. Kilpatrick</p><p>Everyone interested in American history, especially the Civil War years, owes an enormous debt to Douglas Southall Freeman (1886-1953). His acclaimed biographies, including Lee's Lieutenants and the Pulitzer Prize-winning R. E. Lee, are still widely read and enjoyed. Freeman was awarded another Pulitzer for George Washington, and those six volumes remain the definitive work on the first president. Such literary accomplishments would be enough for many writers, but Freeman researched and wrote his books while simultaneously editing a daily newspaper, the Richmond News Leader, from 1915 to 1949 and broadcasting the news twice a day on WRNL Radio.</p><p>Freeman's influence was not confined to Virginia or the South, nor was his expertise limited to studying the past. During World War I, Pres. Woodrow Wilson read Freeman's daily reports about the conflict in Europe. Freeman also acted as friend and advisor to world leaders like Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower. Time Magazine honored him with a cover story and the reporters from Life tried in vain to keep up with his schedule.</p><p>At last, David E. Johnson has produced the first book about this legendary figure and his numerous achievements. Comprehensive in scope and exhaustively researched, Douglas Southall Freeman stands as a biography worthy of its subject.</p></p><h2>Doctor Who: The Massacre (Doctor Who Library)</h2><p>When Doctor Who and Steven journey back in time to 1572, Steven is surprised to learn that the Doctor seems to be behind the persecution of the Huguenots</p><p></p><h2>Mourning Diary</h2><p><p><b>A major discovery: The lost diary of a great mind&#x2015;and an intimate, deeply moving study of grief</b></p><p>The day after his mother's death in October 1977, the influential philosopher Roland Barthes began a diary of mourning. Taking notes on index cards as was his habit, he reflected on a new solitude, on the ebb and flow of sadness, and on modern society's dismissal of grief. These 330 cards, published here for the first time, prove a skeleton key to the themes he tackled throughout his work. Behind the unflagging mind, "the most consistently intelligent, important, and useful literary critic to have emerged anywhere" (Susan Sontag), lay a deeply sensitive man who cherished his mother with a devotion unknown even to his closest friends.</p></p><p><p><b>ROLAND BARTHES</b> was born in 1915. A French literary theorist, philosopher, and critic, he influenced the development of schools of theory, including structuralism, semiotics, existentialism, social theory, Marxism, and post-structuralism. He died in 1980.</p><b>MOURNING DIARY<br>October 26, 1977&#x2013;June 21, 1978<br></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 26, 1977<br></b>First wedding night.But first mourning night?&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 27<br></b>&#x2014;You have never known a Woman&#x2019;s body!&#x2014;I have known the body of my mother, sick and then dying.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 27<br></b>Every morning, around 6:30, in the darkness outside, the metallic racket of the garbage cans.She would say with relief: the night is finally over (she suffered during the night, alone, a cruel business).&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as someone dies, frenzied construction of the future (shifting furniture, etc.): futuromania.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 27</b><br>Who knows?

To find what condition, what life? If someone is to be born, that person will not be blank, but a moral being, a subject of value&#x2014;not of integration.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>October 27<br></b>Immortality.

I walk a few steps with Jean-Louis on one side of the square (with its hideous monument to the dead), bare ground, the smell of rain, the sticks.

The expression I used when I brought maman something, when I was taking care of her. Once, toward the end, half-conscious, she repeated, faintly, Voil� (I&#x2019;m here, a word we used to each other all our lives).The word spoken by the girl at the bakery brought tears to my eyes. I kept on crying quite a while back in the silent apartment.That&#x2019;s how I can grasp my mourning.Not directly in solitude, empirically, etc.; I seem to have a kind of ease, of control that makes people think I&#x2019;m suffering less ...</p><h2>Paul the Convert</h2><p>An account of Paul&#39;s work in which the author argues that Paul&#39;s life can be better understood by taking his Jewishness seriously and that Jewish history can be illuminated greatly be examining Paul&#39;s writings.</p><p>Segal's Saul of Tarsus is a man consumed with uniting Jews and gentiles in a community focused on the resurrected Messiah. Although his efforts largely failed, Paul left behind several thriving gentile congregations and a wealth of primary source material for the study of first-century Judaism. Segal combines New Testament scholarship, modern psychological studies of conversion, and a thorough knowledge of the rabbinic literature to provide the reader with some remarkable insights into Paul's life and writings.

G. Hawkes and His Competitors</h2><p>This authoritative book presents new information about the late nineteenth and early twentieth century cut glass industry in Corning, New York. The recent discovery of a mass of archival material relating to T.G. Hawkes and Company, including thousands of letters, has enabled the author to research business practices in the glass industry in more detail than ever before. Using this new information, together with her already considerable knowledge, Jane Shadel Spillman has produced the first book on American cut glass to go beyond the glass and examine the workings of the industry itself, including labour relations, sources of blanks, special orders for the White House, Hawkes&#39; representation at the Paris world&#39;s fair in 1889, and communication between the cut glass industry and silver manufacturers such as Gorham and Tiffany. Competition and cooperation between the glass cutting firms are also highlighted, and considerable attention is paid to other companies, such as J. Hoare, H.P. Sinclaire, and</p><p>It wasn't until the early 19th-century that a cut-glass industry was established in the United States to meet the increasing demand. In order to avoid labor agitation, one of these first firms moved its plant upstate to Corning, New York, in 1868. The Philadelphia Exposition of 1876 promoted the popularity of cut glass, and soon many more factories were opening in Corning. By 1890, when the T.G. Hawkes company opened for business, the town was promoted as "the Crystal City," and by 1905 it could boast 400 companies. Spillman, curator of American glass at the Corning Museum of Glass, mixes a fascinating look at the cultural history of cut glass with details of the industry, based on recently discovered bills, ledgers, catalogs, and letters from T.G. Hawkes, whose firm remained in business until 1962. This is a fine study of American business as well as of glass design. With 512 illustrations of historic glass pieces, catalog pages, and early advertising, it will also be an important work for glass collectors.

This acknowledged classic contains 365 daily readings that take heady doctrine and make it practical, realistic, and intensely personal. With humor and humility, Chambers speaks plainly to the common man struggling with devotion to Christ in daily living. Worldly cares and self-serving desires begin to lose their appeal as Chambers aides the reader in transforming his mind by viewing life through the instruction of God's Word. Richard Halverson, former chaplain of the United States Senate, attests to this: "no book except the Bible has influenced my walk with Christ at such deep maturing levels." This is Chambers's chief desire, directing the reader to "shut out every other consideration and keep yourself before God for this one thing only--My Utmost for His Highest... determined to be absolutely and entirely for Him and for Him alone." <i>--Jill Heatherly</i><p>It&#x2019;s one of the best-loved devotionals of all time. . .and now it&#x2019;s back in Barbour&#x2019;s special promotional edition!

He analysed the ash content of human cells and identified twelve inorganic tissue-salts that are essential for the healthy functioning of the human body.He showed that when there is a deficiency of any of these salts in the body tissues, certain typical symptoms arise. You can use these symptoms to identify the specific deficiency in the patient. Then all you have to do is supplement the deficient tissue-salt in a dynamic form (6X potency). It will stimulate the vital force of the body, which will in turn carry out the healing. Here is an up-to-date, clear, and concise book. You can use it to heal yourself, your family and friends. It tells you how the common everyday ailments arise in the body and how to use the tissue salts to heal them.

When he first sketched out his brilliant Gaia theory in the 1970s, people around the world embraced it; within a short time Gaia has moved from the margins of scientific research to the mainstream. James Lovelock argues that such things as the level of oxygen, the formation of clouds, and the saltiness of the oceans may all be controlled by interacting physical, chemical, and biological processes. He believes that &#34;the self-regulation of climate and chemical composition is a process that emerges from the tightly coupled evolution of rocks, air, and ocean - in addition to that of organisms. Such interlocking self-regulation, while rarely optimal - consider the cold and hot places of the earth, the wet and the dry - nevertheless keeps the Earth a fit place for life&#34;. The New York Times Book Review has called his arguments in favor of Gaia &#34;plausible and above all illuminating&#34;. Now, in an updated paperback edition, fully revised, the author amplifies his account of how Gaia works with descriptions of new fields of research that have been opened by this pathbreaking concept.James Lovelock is an independent scientist, inventor, and author.

She could pick out three loud&#x2014;painfully loud&#x2014;voices in the crash of distant thunder: Diarmat's, Bellusdeo's and...the Emperor's.

Clearly, Dragon shouting didn't bother him in the slightest.<br><br>Then again, he probably understood what they were saying.<br><br>The palace was never dark. Individual rooms had lighting that responded to the needs of the guests who occupied them, but the halls&#x2014;the grand, wide, towering halls&#x2014;were always fully lit. The Imperial Palace Guard also adorned those halls, standing like statues in a stiff, grim silence that suited their pretension.<br><br>They didn't stop Kaylin as she walked past them, heading to one of the only places that she was certain was somewhat soundproof. They knew her on sight, and if they'd had no issues treating her as one step up from a convicted felon in the past, she was now roommate to the Empire's only female Dragon. The Emperor didn't want anyone to piss Bel-lusdeo off.<br><br>Anyone, Kaylin thought glumly, but the Emperor himself. Dragons had never been famously good at sharing.<br><br>When she reached the tall and forbidding doors of the Imperial Library, she had second thoughts. It wasn't that the Imperial Library was home in all but name to the Arkon, the oldest member of the Dragon Court. It wasn't that the doors were closed; they were almost always closed. It wasn't even his extreme dislike of being interrupted.<br><br>It was the door ward that straddled them.<br><br>She'd woken to the sounds of angry Dragon, which pretty much defined Bad Day. Having to place her palm against this particular ward took Bad Day and made it worse. At the best of times, Kaylin's allergy to magic made door wards uncomfortable&#x2014;but this ward could raise so much noise it might just interrupt the Dragons. One of whom was the Emperor.<br><br>There was no other way to open them. Kaylin briefly considered knocking. With her head. Before she could&#x2014;and it was late enough, or early enough, that she might have&#x2014;the doors surprised her by gliding open. No one stood between them.<br><br>At this hour, the library desk&#x2014;the publicly accessible library desk&#x2014;was unmanned. The display cases and the rows upon rows of standing files were shadowed. The robed clerks who kept the library spotless were conspicuous by their absence&#x2014;but that was no surprise. No one sane visited the library at this hour.<br><br>As the doors rolled closed at her back, the sound of Dragon anger diminished.<br><br>The Arkon made his way toward her from the back of the large room, which surprised Kaylin; she'd expected to find him holed up in one of the many, many rooms that comprised his personal collection&#x2014;none of which the public was invited to peruse.<br><br>"Thank you for opening the doors," she told him.<br><br>"I felt it best to avoid interrupting the ongoing discussion. No one involved in it is likely to be amused by the sudden need to attend to intruders."<br><br>"I live here, at the moment."<br><br>"Indeed. I imagine the only person present who might find a disaster of your making remotely convenient is Lord Diarmat."<br><br>"Who doesn't deserve it."<br><br>"You give him too little credit."<br><br>"Do I?"<br><br>The Arkon's smile was lined. It was also sharp. "Perhaps I will beg the Emperor's indulgence."<br><br>In theory, this sounded good. Given the way the day had started, it couldn't be. "How?"<br><br>"I might ask permission to teach you the rudiments of our language." His smile deepened as her eyes rounded and her brows rose.<br><br>"I'll go deaf!"<br><br>"Yes. Follow me, please. You interrupted me," he added. "I don't know how you can work with that ruckus going on in the background."<br><br>"It is difficult. I do not have the concentration I once possessed in my youth."<br><br>"So, what are they arguing about exactly?"<br><br>"Bellusdeo's status at court, at the moment; the argument has touched on many subjects." The Arkon's eyes were a steady shade of orange, which wasn't a good sign, in a Dragon.<br><br>"What about her status? She's a Dragon, so she's technically a Lord of the Court."<br><br>"That is true only in mortal terms. She is not&#x2014;as Diarmat has been at pains to point out&#x2014;a Lord of <em>this</em> Court. She has not offered the Emperor an oath of fealty; nor has she agreed&#x2014;in a binding fashion&#x2014;to abide by the laws he hands down."<br><br>"She spends most of her free time with <em>me,"</em> Kaylin replied. "I'm a groundhawk. She probably knows the law better than anyone who isn't."<br><br>"You misunderstand. Humans are not, of course, required to take such a binding oath&#x2014;I believe they would not survive it. Bellusdeo has not been required to do so. Lord Diar-mat correctly points out that she therefore poses a risk to the Court." He stopped at a smooth, flat wall. It was unadorned; Kaylin suspected it was actually a door.<br><br>The Arkon barked a sharp, harsh word and proved her suspicion correct; a part of the wall simply faded from sight. What lay on the other side of it was a disaster. It made Kay-lin's desk at its worst look pristine and tidy. Hells, it made Marcus's desk look wellorganized, which Kaylin would have bet was impossible.<br><br>The Arkon noted her hesitation. "Is there a difficulty?"<br><br>"Just how important is all the paper&#x2014;that is paper, isn't it?"<br><br>"Parchment. Some paper. There is also stone and a few shards of smooth glass. I trust that you will disturb nothing while you are here."<br><br>"How?"<br><br>He raised a brow; his eyes didn't get any more orange, which was a small mercy.<br><br>"There's stuff all over the <em>floor.</em> There's stuff all over the chairs. I probably can't put a foot down without stepping on something."<br><br>"Then do not, as you put it, put a foot down." He gestured.<br><br>The hair on Kaylin's arms and the back of her neck rose in instant protest.<br><br>"Do not," he said, in a more severe tone of voice, "make me regret my foolish and sentimental decision to take pity on you and provide you some form of refuge."<br><br>Folding her arms across her chest, she walked into the room; her feet touched nothing. Neither did the Arkon's.<br><br>"Not to be suspicious or anything," she began.<br><br>"You do not think me capable of either sentiment or pity?"<br><br>"Not much, no. Not for me."<br><br>His smile deepened. "As you point out, Private, Bellusdeo did spend most of her free time in your presence. You have not, however, been in the city for the past month and a half. She has therefore had no anchor. No friends, if you prefer. In the last two weeks of your absence, she has spent a greater portion of her time in the fief of Tiamaris, speaking with the refugees there. When she chooses to enter the fief, she is met by one of the <em>Norannir"</em><br><br>"That would be Maggaron."<br><br>"The Emperor does not consider Maggaron to be a suitable guard in the fiefs; Lord Tiamaris, however, is. She has accepted&#x2014;with poor grace&#x2014;the Emperor's wishes in this regard."<br><br>"What happened?"<br><br>"She has taken to flying in the restricted air-space above the fief of Tiamaris."<br><br>"It's not Imperial land."<br><br>"No. She has pointed this out&#x2014;at length. You might have recognized one or two of the words she used, if you were paying attention. She has, however, come close to the borders of the fief once too often for the Emperor's comfort."<br><br>"The <em>Norannir</em> live on the borders."<br><br>"Indeed. She has taken pains to point this out, as well."<br><br>"He's going to isolate her! The <em>Norannir</em> are the only other friends she has in this city!"<br><br>The Arkon's smile was softer, and infinitely more pained. "They are not her friends, Kaylin. They were once her subjects. She is not merely a Dragon to them; she is akin to a living god. Bellusdeo has her vanity. She has her pride. But she, like any Dragon, understands her role in their lives. She does not go to them for their sake, but her own. They remind her of who she once was.<br><br>"There is altogether too much in the Palace that reminds her of what she now is."<br><br>Kaylin's arms tightened. "And what, exactly, is that?"<br><br>"A displaced person. She is very much the equivalent of the <em>Norannir.</em> You think of her as a Lord of the Court, and you have some rudimentary understanding of the political power that title might give her. She lives in the Palace, and not in the mean streets of the fiefs that border <em>Ravellon.</em> She has food, should she desire it, and clothing; she has money. But the <em>Norannir</em> have more freedom than Bellusdeo now does."<br><br>"Why are you telling me this? Why not say this to the Emperor?"<br><br>"Do you think I have not?" His eyes shaded to a color that was more copper than orange. Kaylin couldn't remember what it meant, she'd seen it so rarely. In fact, she'd seen it only once: in Bellusdeo's eyes. "I have told the Emperor that Bellusdeo cannot live in a cage. He does not intend to cage her&#x2014;but regardless, he does. She is too valuable to risk. We have already seen how close to disaster we came."<br><br>"Arkon&#x2014;" Kaylin froze, and only in part because the muted draconic voices had risen in volume. "Please tell me this argument has nothing to do with my moving out."<br><br>"You are not, that I recall, fond of unnecessary dishonesty." He took a seat. It was the only seat in the room that seemed to have enough exposed surface to sit on. "If Bellusdeo can be said to have one friend in the Empire, it is you. She found your absence far more difficult than either she&#x2014;or you&#x2014;had imagined she would."<br><br>"She said this?"<br><br>"Of course not." He winced; it took Kaylin a couple of seconds to realize it wasn't because of anything she'd said. Unlike her, he could understand every word that was being said. Or shouted. "You have made it clear to Bellusdeo that life in the Imperial Palace does not suit you."<br><br>"Not in those exact words, no."<br><br>"Refrain from repeating the exact phrasing."<br><br>Because Kaylin loved her job on most days, she did.<br><br>"You intend to find another domicile?"<br><br>"Yes. As soon as I can." When he lifted a brow, she thought of the job she loved&#x2014;none of which included pandering to annoyed Dragons. On the other hand, survival often did. "Look, there are people who would kill to live in the Palace. I'm certain of it. But they're the people the Hawklord goes out of his way to prevent me from meeting. Everything in my Palace rooms&#x2014;everything&#x2014;costs more than the clothing on my back. I feel like I should bathe <em>before</em> I step foot through the door.<br><br>"I can't leave or enter without an inquisition. I have to deal with Imperial Guards on a daily basis for no other reason than that I live here."<br><br>"They are there for the protection and security of our guests."<br><br>"Fine. But I don't want to <em>be</em> a guest in my own home. I want to be able to <em>live there.</em> Bellusdeo is a Dragon. When she dons Court dresses, they fit her <em>and</em> look good. She understands the powerful. She <em>has</em> power. I'm a groundhawk. I can barely make ends meet on my cruddy pay. I'm not in her class&#x2014;and I know it.<br><br>"I came from the fiefs. I work on the streets. I don't belong here, and I can't be happy where I don't belong."<br><br>"You are a Lord of the High Court."<br><br>"The Barrani High Court, and you know damn well I don't have to live in the High Halls."<br><br>"You have visited them before."<br><br>"I visited them with <em>Teela."</em><br><br>"And the difference?"<br><br>She grimaced. There was a difference. She wasn't certain what it was. "Teela's a Hawk."<br><br>"And Bellusdeo is not."<br><br>"Bellusdeo would never swear the oath the Halls of Law require."<br><br>"No. Lord Teela did?"<br><br>"Lord Teela doesn't give a damn about nonbinding oaths. They're just words, as far as the Barrani are concerned. There is no way Marcus would ever allow Bellusdeo to join the Hawks."<br><br>"Ah, yes. Your Sergeant's famous mistrust of my kind." His eyes, however, shaded toward gold. He clearly found Marcus amusing. "Your Teela understands the High Court, and she avoids it where possible. But if you enter that world, she enters it beside you&#x2014;and she warns others, by presence alone, that there are consequences to any actions they might take against you. Bellusdeo cannot do that, here. And she is aware that she lacks that ability; the Palace is not her home. It is not an environment with which she is familiar, or over which she has ultimate control.<br><br>"Still, she tries. She targets Diarmat with the full brunt of her outraged disdain. Her outrage," he added, "is genuine. She feels your marks are not accorded the respect they are due. She does not fully consider the advantage in being underestimated&#x2014;and I will say, now, that there is a distinct advantage to you, in my opinion. She feels a debt of gratitude to you."<br><br>"I didn't do anything for her gratitude. I did it because...because____"<br><br>"Oh, do continue. I'm certain it will be fascinating. You did it because that's what anyone would do?"<br><br>Kaylin shrugged. It was a fief shrug. Fief shrugs, on the other...</p><h2>Halt!: I&#39;m a Federal Game Warden: The amazing career of &#34;the toughest game warden of them all&#34;</h2><p>For nearly 30 years, Willie Parker has patrolled nesting grounds, nabbed poachers, and on occasion resorted to disguise, protecting the wildlife of Tennessee, Louisiana, Kentucky, and Maryland. He&#39;s not arbitrary; everyone in the territory knows his goose is cooked if this federal agent flushes him out. In his own salty idiom, Willie recalls his more colorful catches--surprising early hunters out to get him, hoodwinking a ring of alligator skinners, drinking it up on an undercover operation so the waterfowl black marketeers wouldn&#39;t suspect a set-up. Without exception, the violators are trundled off to the local magistrate and, with a boost from recent legislation, treated to some embarrassment and stiffer fines. Pat, his Labrador retriever, often comes along, and other agents--including the first woman--come across as equally committed.

The show has profiled every major leader, artist, and movement of the past five decades, perfecting the news-making interview and inventing the groundbreaking TV expose. From legendary sit-downs with Richard Nixon in 1968 (in which he promised &#x201c;to restore respect to the presidency&#x201d;) and Bill Clinton in 1992 (after the first revelations of infidelity) to landmark investigations into the tobacco industry, Lance Armstrong&#x2019;s doping, and the torture of prisoners in Abu-Ghraib, the broadcast has not just reported on our world but changed it too.<br> <br>Now, Executive Producer Jeff Fager pulls back the curtain on how this remarkable journalism is done, taking the reader into the editing room with the show&#x2019;s brilliant producers and beloved correspondents, including hard-charging Mike Wallace, writer&#x2019;s-writer Morley Safer, soft-but-tough Ed Bradley, relentless Lesley Stahl, ace interviewer Charlie Rose, tireless Anderson Cooper, intrepid Scott Pelley, and illuminating storyteller Steve Kroft. He details the decades of human drama that have made the show&#x2019;s success possible: the ferocious (and encouraged) competition between correspondents, the door slamming, the risk-taking, and the pranks. Fager takes on the program&#x2019;s mistakes and describes what it learned from them. Above all, he reveals the essential tenets that have never changed: why founder Don Hewitt believed &#x201c;hearing&#x201d; a story is more important than seeing it, why the &#x201c;small picture&#x201d; is the best way to illuminate a larger one, and why the most memorable stories are almost always those with a human being at the center.<br> <br>At once a sweeping portrait of fifty years of American cultural history and an intimate look at how the news gets made, <i>Fifty Years of 60 Minutes</i> shares the secret of what&#x2019;s made the nation&#x2019;s favorite TV program exceptional for all these years.</p><p>Jeff Fager is in his fourteenth season as the Executive Producer of <i>60 Minutes</i>.

The character has become a multi-faceted industry. as famous in our world today as he was in his own world during The Hyborian Age. More than 50 novels and countless short stories featuring Conan have been written by a diversity of authors, but the stories contained in this massive volume are all by the character&#39;s creator, Robert E. Howard. Originally written by Howard to be published in the magazine Weird Tales in the 1930s, these include the first published Conan story &#34;The Pheonix on the Sword&#34; and short stories such as &#34;The Tower of the Elephant&#34; through to longer tales like &#34;A Witch Shall Be Born&#34; and the novel &#34;The Hour of the Dragon.&#34; Although many have taken up the challenge to extend Conan&#39;s adventures over the years, Howard was a master of his craft, lovingly creating a mythical world in which his original masterpieces reign supreme.</p><p></p><h2>The Animals&#39; Merry Christmas</h2><p>Golden Books is proud to reissue this beloved Christmas collection, chock-full of funny animal stories and poems.

Designed for college-level courses such as Old Testament Survey or Biblical Literature, this book is intended to be used in conjunction with one of the excellent study Bibles now available, particularly the NIV Study Bible. With each chapter of Yesterday, Today and Forever, Helyer prescribes significant scripture readings. Throughout the book he provides a detailed look at the broad themes that run through the Old Testament and are still relevant today.</p><p>For whatever reasons, many Christian students come to the academic study of the Old Testament viewing it as remote and irrelevant. For many, compared to the New Testament, it has little to offer. The thrust of this book is the very opposite(the Old Testament is essential for a balanced Christian life. This text seeks to explore with the student how the Old Testament still functions as God&#39;s Word, &#34;profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness&#34; (2Ti 3:16 RSV).The basic theological issues of the Old Testament are as relevant now, at the end of the 20th century, as they were when originally penned. The reason lies in the unchanging nature of what it means to be human. The fundamental questions of human existence are theological questions(questions which are the same at all times and in all cultures. Questions like: Who am I? How did the world begin? Is there a God? What is God like? How can I know and please God? What will happen to me and the world? The essential message of the Old Testament speaks to these enduring questions, so the passage of centuries has not rendered it out-of-date. This book is designed to give the reader a grasp of the overall message of the Old Testament. It also attempts to show the significance of the message for our own day at the end of the twentieth century.</p><h2>The Fox Went Out On A Chilly Night</h2><p>A picture story of an old folk song about a fox family&#39;s feast of a stolen goose and duck</p><p>For the farmer, there's nothing to appreciate about a pesky fox stealing poultry from the henhouse. But for the fox's kits� there's nothing like the triumphant return of dad with food to the den, and for the listener there's nothing like Tom Chapin performing this well-loved folk song. As narrator, Chapin is direct and unobtrusive as he lets Peter Spier's award-winning illustrations share the story. Background music is light, and well-selected sound effects heighten the setting. Chapin's music brings animation and pleasure. The fox's step is quick and light; Mother Giggle Gaggle is indignant; the hunting horns, majestic; and the feast, resplendent. Children will enjoy the "quack, quack, quack" and "bones-o, bones-o" refrains.

Creator of the popular Meet Danitra Brown, Ms. Grimes lives in California.</p>Grimes brings her lyrical style---and a compassionate, human-centered tone---to the Nativity story. Each double-page spread comprises three parts: a character&#x2019;s portrait is vividly rendered; a biblical passage establishes the current segment of the overarching narrative; and a poem offers readers entrance to the story through the eyes of the spotlighted character, from Gabriel to Mary to Herod to the innkeeper. The monologues are sparely poetic, emphasizing the humanity of each iconic figure: after being told that she will deliver the child of God, Mary is &#x201c;rooted to this dirt floor, / dizzy with wonder, / pinching my wrist, / waiting to wake / from this dream.&#x201d; The text is unabashedly spiritual; the book design is sumptuous, with its gold typeface and endpapers; the paintings are dramatically composed, alternately dark and luminous (or sometimes both). Together, they make a familiar story seem newly resonant. (<i>The Horn Book Magazine</i>)<br><br>Grimes presents 14 poems, each preceded by a Bible verse, telling the story of the Nativity through the voices of Mary, Joseph, the Wise Men, the innkeeper, Herod, and so on. The poems, mostly unrhymed free verse, use simple language and a rolling rhythm that makes them a pleasure to read aloud. Gaspar, one of the Wise Men, begins his verse with &#x201c;All those years of poring over/charts and scrolls on astronomy,/then suddenly, it was as if/the Morning Star/leapt from the page/and rose into the sky.&#x201d; The realistic paintings, rendered in muted nighttime shades of blue, gray, brown, and yellow, depict intense people in the midst of a momentous event, their glowing faces bowed in reverence or raised to the heavens. This lovely and heartfelt book adds a deeper perspective to the oft-told story and will enhance most holiday collections.&#x2013;Eva Mitnick, Los Angeles Public Library (<i>School Library Journal</i>)<br><br>Grimes uses her talent as a poet to retell the Nativity story from several different viewpoints, each one a distinct voice with its own style. Fourteen poems in free verse convey the story, from the announcement of the impending birth by the angel Gabriel to the final poem directed to readers. The attractive design includes a double-page spread for each character, with a short Bible verse and the poem set in gold type against dark backgrounds and the illustration of the character attractively integrated into the spread. Each character is a real person with his or her own concerns and fears, and the whole of the Nativity story is conveyed through the sum of their individual stories. Velasquez's striking, dramatic illustrations add to the personality of the characters, who are clearly of Middle Eastern ethnicity.

Reading Joseph Heller&#39;s classic satire is nothing less than a rite of passage. Set in the closing months of World War II, this is the story of a bombardier named Yossarian who is frantic and furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. His real problem is not the enemy - it is his own army which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. If Yossarian makes any attempts to excuse himself from the perilous missions then he is caught in Catch-22: if he flies he is crazy, and doesn&#39;t have to; but if he doesn&#39;t want to he must be sane and has to. That&#39;s some catch...</p><p>There was a time when reading Joseph Heller's classic satire on the murderous insanity of war was nothing less than a rite of passage. Echoes of Yossarian, the wise-ass bombardier who was too smart to die but not smart enough to find a way out of his predicament, could be heard throughout the counterculture. As a result, it's impossible not to consider <i>Catch-22</i> to be something of a period piece. But 40 years on, the novel's undiminished strength is its looking-glass logic. Again and again, Heller's characters demonstrate that what is commonly held to be good, is bad; what is sensible, is nonsense. <p> Yossarian says, "You're talking about winning the war, and I am talking about winning the war and keeping alive." <br> "Exactly," Clevinger snapped smugly. "And which do you think is more important?" <br> "To whom?" Yossarian shot back. "It doesn't make a damn bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead." <br> "I can't think of another attitude that could be depended upon to give greater comfort to the enemy." <br> "The enemy," retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, "is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on." <br> Mirabile dictu, the book holds up post-Reagan, post-Gulf War. It's a good thing, too. As long as there's a military, that engine of lethal authority, <i>Catch-22</i> will shine as a handbook for smart-alecky pacifists. It's an utterly serious and sad, but damn funny book.</p>Joseph Heller was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1923. In 1961, he published Catch-22, which became a bestseller and, in 1970, a film. He went on to write such novels as Something Happened, God Knows, Picture This, Closing Time (the sequel to Catch-22), and Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man. Heller died in December 1999.</p><h2>Vital Breath of the Dao: Chinese Shamanic Tiger Qigong</h2><p>"Master Wu's sixth book&#x2014;his first in English&#x2014;is a seminal work in the field of Qigong. For Westerners interested in this fascinating healing art, it opens a window into the little-known Shamanic roots of Qigong. Master Wu's compassion</p><p>Master Zhongxian Wu was born on China&#x2019;s eastern shore in the city of Wenlin in Zhejiang Province, where the sun&#x2019;s rays first touch the Chinese mainland. He began practicing Qigong, calligraphy, and Taiji at an early age. Inspired by the immediate strengthening effects of this practice, Master Wu committed himself to the life-long pursuit of the ancient arts of internal cultivation. He devoted himself to the study of Qigong, martial arts, Chinese medicine, Yijing science, Chinese calligraphy, and ancient Chinese music over the next thirty years, studying with some of the best teachers in these fields. Master Wu is the lineage holder of four different schools of Qigong and martial arts: � 18th generation lineage holder of the Mt. Wudang Dragon Gate style of Qigong (Wudang Longmen Pai) � 8th generation lineage holder of the Mt. Emei Sage/Shaman style Qigong (Emei Zhengong) � 7th generation lineage holder of the Dai Family Heart Method style of Xin Yi (Dai Shi Xinyi Quan) � 12th generation lineage holder of the Wudang He style of Taijiquan. In China, Master Wu served as Director of the Shanxi Province Association for Somatic Science and the Shaanxi Association for the Research of Daoist Nourishing Life Practices. In this capacity, he conducted many investigations into the clinical efficacy of Qigong and authored five books and numerous articles on the philosophical and historical foundations of China&#x2019;s ancient life sciences. Since he began teaching in 1988, Master Wu has instructed thousands of Qigong students, Eastern and Western.

A well-published author, married many times, she has lived a life rich with explorations of the natural world and the human soul. Now, at fifty-seven, she leaves her lover, Yolo, to embark on a new excursion, one that begins on the Colorado River, proceeds through the past, and flows, inexorably, into the future. As Yolo begins his own parallel voyage, Kate encounters celibates and lovers, shamans and snakes, memories of family disaster and marital discord, and emerges at a place where nothing remains but love. <br><br>Told with the accessible style and deep feeling that are its author&#x2019;s hallmarks, <b>Now Is the Time to Open Your Heart</b> is Alice Walker&#x2019;s most surprising achievement.</p><p><b>ALICE WALKER</b> won the Pulitzer Prize and the American Book Award for her novel <b>The Color Purple</b>. Her other novels include <b>By the Light of My Father&#x2019;s Smile </b>and<b> Possessing the Secret of Joy</b>. She is also the author of three collections of short stories, three collections of essays, five volumes of poetry, and several children&#x2019;s books. Born in Eatonton, Georgia, Walker now lives in northern California.<b>Cool Revolution</b><br><br>kate talkingtree sat meditating in a large hall that was surrounded by redwood trees. Although the deep shade of the trees usually kept the room quite cool, today was unseasonably warm and Kate, with everybody else, was beginning to perspire. They had been meditating, on and off their cushions, for most of the morning, beginning at five-thirty when they roused themselves, at the sound of the bell, from their beds. When they broke from meditating inside, they quietly made their way outside and into the courtyard. Up and down the path that led to the front door of the hall they did a walking meditation that had been taught them by a lot of different Buddhist teachers, some from America and some from Asia. It was a slow, graceful meditation that she liked; she enjoyed the feeling of a heel touching the earth long before a toe followed it. Meditating this way made her feel almost as slow as vegetation; it went well with her new name, a name she&#x2019;d taken earlier, in the spring.<br><br>Ever since she was small she&#x2019;d felt a wary futility about talking. At the same time she realized it was something that, in order for the world to understand itself at all, had to be done. Her old last name had been Nelson, and for a time she&#x2019;d thought of calling herself Kate Nelson-Fir. She loved fir trees, especially the magnificent, towering ones that grew on the Northwest coast.<br><br>When it was time for the dharma talk to begin Kate made her way to a spot close enough to see and hear the teacher very easily. He was a middle-aged man of southern European descent, with an ecru complexion and a shining bald head. His brown eyes twinkled as he talked. Every once in a while he reached up and stroked the silver earring in his left ear. Because of the earring and because he seemed spotless in his flowing robes, she mentally dubbed him Mr. Clean. She had been coming to his talks every day for more than a week, and had enjoyed them very much. Today he was talking about the misguided notion that a &#x201c;hot&#x201d; revolution, with guns and violence, such as the ones attempted in Africa, Cuba, and the Caribbean, could ever succeed. He seemed unaware that these revolutions had been undermined not only by their own shortcomings but also by military interference from the United States. The only revolution that could possibly succeed, he maintained, smiling, was the &#x201c;cool&#x201d; one introduced to the world by the Lord Buddha, twenty-five hundred years ago.<br><br>Something about this statement did not sit well with Kate. She looked at him carefully. He was certainly a well-fed-looking soul, she thought. Not many meals missed by that one, except by accident. Quietly glancing down at the program on the floor beside her, she saw he had grown up in an upper-middle-class home, had had educated and cultured people as parents and as grandparents, had studied and lived in Europe as well as in the East. Was now a prominent professor at one of the country&#x2019;s most famous universities. Easy enough for him to dismiss the brown and black and yellow and poor white people all over the globe who worried constantly where their next meal was coming from, she thought. How they would feed, clothe, and educate their children. Who, if they did sit down to meditate, would probably be driven up again by the lash. Or by military death squads, or by hunger, or by . . . the list was long.<br><br>Looking around her she noticed most of the meditators shared the teacher&#x2019;s somewhat smug, well-fed look. They were overwhelmingly white and middle- to upper-middle-class and had the money and leisure time to be at a retreat. In fact, she noted, she seemed to be the only person of color there. What was wrong with this picture?<br><br>Her mind, which had been clear as a reflecting pool just minutes before, now became cloudy. This was exactly what meditation was meant to prevent. She took a deep breath, labeled her thoughts &#x201c;thinking,&#x201d; as she&#x2019;d been instructed to do if her mind wandered during meditation, and settled herself more firmly on her cushion. She would listen to this teacher, whom she indeed respected very much, and she would not be critical. Besides, she knew what he meant. There was a way in which all &#x201c;hot&#x201d; revolutions defeated themselves, because they spawned enemies. Look at those crazy ex-Cubans in Miami, for instance, who never recovered from having some of their power taken away, and the endless amount of confusion, pain, and suffering they caused.<br><br>After the talk she began to think in earnest. She felt she had reached an impasse on the Buddhist road.<br><br>That evening and the next day and the next she found herself unable to meditate. She kept looking out the window instead, just as she had looked out of the window of the Church of God and Christ, as a child, when she had been unable to believe human beings, simply by being born, had sinned. The redwood trees looked so restful, their long branches hanging down to the earth. Each tree created a little house, a shelter, around itself. Just right for a human or two to sit. She hadn&#x2019;t realized this before, how thoughtful this was. But on her very next walking meditation she slowly, slowly, made her way to the largest redwood tree and sat under it, becoming invisible to the dozens of people who continued their walking meditation and slowly walked all around her.<br><br>When everybody else returned to the meditation hall, she did not.</p><h2>Paw Patrol: Tie Your Shoes With The Paw Patrol!</h2><p>a BOOK ABOUT DOGS</p><p></p><h2>Drawing from Observation: An Introduction to Perceptual Drawing</h2><p>Perceptual drawing, in which one renders the physical world as it appears to an observer, is the focus of this new text for the introductory drawing course.

There is great comfort and wisdom in knowing we can increase our awareness to manage the swift and ancient mechanisms of social control. We can gain greater flexibility by seeing how social controls work in systems from ants to humans. To be less controlled by others, we learn how emotional systems influence our relationship-oriented brain. People want to know what goes on in families that give rise to amazing leaders and/or terrorists. For the first time in history we can understand the systems in which we live. The social sciences have been accumulating knowledge since the early fifties as to how we are regulated by others. S. Milgram, S. Ashe, P. Zimbardo and J. Calhoun, detail the vulnerability to being duped and deceived and the difficulty of cooperating when values differ. Murray Bowen, M.D., the first researcher to observe several live-in families, for up to three years, at the National Institute of Mental Health. Describing how family members overly influence one another and distribute stress unevenly, Bowen described both how symptoms and family leaders emerge in highly stressed families. Our brain is not organized to automatically perceive that each family has an emotional system, fine-tuned by evolution and &#x201c;valuing&#x201d; its survival as a whole, as much as the survival of any individual. It is easier to see this emotional system function in ants or mice but not in humans. The emotional system is organized to snooker us humans: encouraging us to take sides, run away from others, to pressure others, to get sick, to blame others, and to have great difficulty in seeing our part in problems. It is hard to see that we become anxious, stressed out and even that we are difficult to deal with. But &#x201c;thinking systems&#x201d; can open the doors of perception, allowing us to experience the world in a different way. This book offers both coaching ideas and stories from leaders as to strategies to break out from social control by de-triangling, using paradoxes, reversals and other types of interruptions of highly linked emotional processes. Time is needed to think clearly about the automatic nature of the two against one triangle. Time and experience is required as we learn strategies to put two people together and get self outside the control of the system. In addition, it takes time to clarify and define one&#x2019;s principles, to know what &#x201c;I&#x201d; will or will not do and to be able to take a stand with others with whom we are very involved. The good news is that systems&#x2019; thinking is possible for anyone. It is always possible for an individual to understand feelings and to integrate them with their more rational brains. In so doing, an individual increases his or her ability to communicate despite misunderstandings or even rejection from important others. The effort involved in creating your Mindful Compass enables us to perceive the relationship system without experiencing it's threats. The four points on the Mindful Compass are: 1) Action for Self, 2) Resistance to Forward Progress, 3) Knowledge of Social Systems and the 4) The Ability to Stand Alone. Each gives us a view of the process one enters when making an effort to define a self and build an emotional backbone. It is not easy to find our way through the social jungle. The ability to know emotional systems well enough to take a position for self and to become more differentiated is part of the natural way humans cope with pressure. Now people can use available knowledge to build an emotional backbone, by thoughtfully altering their part in the relationship system. No one knows how far one can go by making an effort to be more of a self-defined individual in relationships to others. Through increasing emotional maturity, we can find greater individual freedom at the same time that we increase our ability to cooperate and to be close to others.</p><p>Andrea M.

Reed The Man Who Broke the Filibuster</h2><p>James Grant&#x2019;s enthralling biography of Thomas B. Reed, Speaker of the House during one of the most turbulent times in American history&#x2014;the Gilded Age, the decades before the ascension of reformer President Theodore Roosevelt&#x2014;brings to life one of the brightest, wittiest, and most consequential political stars in our history. <br><br>The last decades of the nineteenth century were a volatile era of rampantly corrupt politics. It was a time of both stupendous growth and financial panic, of land bubbles and passionate and sometimes violent populist protests. Votes were openly bought and sold in a Congress paralyzed by the abuse of the House filibuster by members who refused to respond to roll call even when present, depriving the body of a quorum. Reed put an end to this stalemate, empowered the Republicans, and changed the House of Representatives for all time. <br><br>The Speaker&#x2019;s beliefs in majority rule were put to the test in 1898, when the sinking of the U.S.S. <i>Maine </i>in Havana Harbor set up a popular clamor for war against Spain. Reed resigned from Congress in protest. <br><br>A larger-than-life character, Reed checks every box of the ideal biographical subject. He is an important and significant figure. He changed forever the way the House of Representatives does its business. He was funny and irreverent. He is, in short, great company. &#x201c;What I most admire about you, Theodore,&#x201d; Reed once remarked to his earnest young prot�g�, Teddy Roosevelt, &#x201c;is your original discovery of the Ten Commandments.&#x201d; <br><br>After he resigned his seat, Reed practiced law in New York. He was successful. He also found a soul mate in the legendary Mark Twain. They admired one another&#x2019;s mordant wit. Grant&#x2019;s lively and erudite narrative of this tumultuous era&#x2014;the raucous late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries&#x2014;is a gripping portrait of a United States poised to burst its bounds and of the men who were defining it.</p><p>James Grant is the founder of <i>Grant&#x2019;s Interest Rate Observer</i>, a leading journal on financial markets, which he has published since 1983. He is the author of seven books covering both financial history and biography. Grant&#x2019;s journalism has been featured in <i>Financial Times</i>,<i> The Wall Street Journal</i>, and <i>Foreign </i>Affairs. He has appeared on <i>60 Minutes</i>,<i> Jim Lehrer&#x2019;s News Hour</i>, and <i>CBS Evening News.</i><b> <b> <i>Preface</i> </b> </b> <br> <br>THOMAS BRACKETT REED was the rock-ribbed Maine Republican who led the U.S. House of Representatives into the modern era of big government. From the Speaker&#x2019;s chair early in 1890, he unilaterally stripped the legislative minority of the power to obstruct the law-making agenda of the majority. Enraged Democrats branded him a &#x201c;czar,&#x201d; which epithet Reed seemed not to mind at all.<br> <br>Modernity was Reed&#x2019;s cause from his first Congress in 1877 to the day he resigned in protest over America&#x2019;s war of choice with Spain. As society was moving forward, he contended, so must the government and the laws. That meant, for instance, the abolition of capital punishment, a cause he championed while representing Portland in the Maine legislature immediately following the Civil War. On the national stage, it meant protective tariffs, peace, women&#x2019;s suffrage, federally protected voting rights for African-Americans and a strong navy. He heaped ridicule on the Democrats for their Jeffersonian insistence on strictly limited federal powers. The tragedy of Reed&#x2019;s political life was that the government he helped to cultivate and finance turned warlike and muscular, just as his Democratic antagonists had predicted it would. His friend and onetime prot�g� Theodore Roosevelt rode that trend into the history books. Reed, heartsick, retired to Wall Street to practice law.<br> <br>Peace and prosperity make a superior backdrop to everyday living, but they do not necessarily commend an era to the readers or writers of history. Not that either Reed&#x2019;s life (1839&#x2013;1902) or his times were anything but eventful. Boom and bust, free trade or protection, race, the rights of subject peoples and the relationship between the individual and the state were the staple points of conflict during his quarter-century in politics.<br> <br>Czar Reed had a suitably tyrannical presence, standing well over six feet tall and weighing close to 300 pounds. He married a clergyman&#x2019;s daughter, Susan P. Jones, who opposed women&#x2019;s suffrage; Katherine, their daughter, lived to advocate it. Reed&#x2019;s eyes beamed with intelligence but his massive face was bland enough to stump the portraitist John Singer Sargent. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Reed quipped as he beheld the painter&#x2019;s failed likeness of himself in 1891, &#x201c;I hope my enemies are satisfied.&#x201d;<br> <br>The party labels of Reed&#x2019;s day may seem now as if they were stuck on backwards. At that time, the GOP was the party of active government, the Democratic party, the champion of laissez-faire. The Republicans&#x2019; sage was Alexander Hamilton, the Democrats&#x2019;, Thomas Jefferson. The Republicans condemned the Democrats for their parsimony with public funds, the Democrats arraigned the Republicans for their waste and extravagance. And what, in those days, constituted extravagance in federal spending? Arguing in support of a bill to appropriate funds for a new building to house the overcrowded collection of the Library of Congress, Reed had to answer critics who charged that Congress should do without the books rather than raid the Treasury and raise up one more imperial structure to crowd the capital city&#x2019;s already grandiose thoroughfares.<br> <br>The library fight was waged with words, but the politics of Reed&#x2019;s time were shockingly violent. It was embarrassing to Reed to have to try to explain away to his congressional colleagues the near war that erupted in his home state over the stolen 1879 Maine gubernatorial election. Reed had grown used to political bloodshed in the conquered South, but even he, worldwise as he was, had never expected the descendants of the Puritan saints to have to call out the militia to get an honest count of a New England vote. Meanwhile, in Washington, on the floor of the House of Representatives, ex-soldiers would put aside public business to hurl charges and countercharges over the wartime atrocities at Andersonville or Fort Pillow. Reed himself was not above the occasional jibe at the ex-Confederates&#x2014;&#x201c;waving the bloody shirt,&#x201d; this style of political discourse was called&#x2014;but he affected not one jot of martial vainglory. A supply officer aboard a Union gunboat on the Mississippi River in the final year of the war, he drew no fire except the verbal kind from his own commanding officer.<br> <br>As a professional politician, Reed could talk with the best of them. In the House, he was the acknowledged master of the impromptu five-minute speech and of the cutting, 10-second remark. He talked himself into 12 consecutive congresses, including three in which he occupied the Speaker&#x2019;s chair. &#x201c;The gentleman needn&#x2019;t worry. He will never be either,&#x201d; he once remarked to a Democrat who was rash enough to quote Henry Clay&#x2019;s line about rather being right than president.<br> <br>Reed&#x2019;s wit was his bane and glory. An acquaintance correctly observed that he would rather make an epigram than a friend. Too often, he made an epigram and an enemy. &#x201c;They can do worse,&#x201d; he said of the Republicans who were sizing him up for the GOP presidential nomination in 1896. &#x201c;And they probably will,&#x201d; he added prophetically. In the museless and pleasant William McKinley, the Republicans did, in fact, do much worse. Mark Hanna, McKinley&#x2019;s strategist and the first of the modern American political kingmakers, set his agents to mingle in the western crowds that Reed sought to charm in the 1896 campaign season. &#x201c;There was nothing Lincolnian about Reed, obese, dapper and sarcastic,&#x201d; Hanna&#x2019;s biographer recorded. &#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t too friendly when they came up to shake hands after meetings. He was an Eastern Product.&#x201d;<br> <br>That Reed fell short of the presidency was his contemporaries&#x2019; loss, even more than his own. That he has made so small a mark in the modern historical record is a deficiency that this book intends to rectify. The Gilded Age produced no wiser, funnier or more colorful politician than Speaker Reed, and none whose interests and struggles more nearly anticipated our own. Reed, like us, debated the morality of a war that America chose to instigate. He wrestled with the efficacy of protecting American workers and their employers from foreign competition and resisted the calls of those who would cheapen the value of the dollar. He was&#x2014;as it might be condescendingly said of him today&#x2014;ahead of his time on issues of race and gender. Actually, in many ways, his views harkened back to those of the Founders. Too loyal a Republican to speak out against the McKinley administration&#x2019;s war in the Philippines, Reed would let drop the subversive remark that he believed in the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence. Roosevelt wondered what had gotten into him.<br> <br>If Reed resigned from Congress in bitterness, he served with zest. He loved the House and especially the Speakership, an office, as he liked to say, that was &#x201c;without peer and with but one superior.&#x201d; In parliamentary finesse and imagination, he was among the greatest Speakers. Such 21st century political scientists as Randall Strahan and Rick Valelly rank him on a par with the great Henry Clay of Kentucky. Reed&#x2019;s signal achievement was to institute an era of activist legislation to displace the prevailing system of party stalemate. Empowered by the rules he himself imposed, the Republican majority of the 51st Congress, 1890&#x2013;92, passed more bills and appropriated more money than any preceding peacetime Congress. To critics who decried the appropriations record of that Congress&#x2014;a shocking $1 billion&#x2014;Reed approvingly quoted someone else&#x2019;s witticism: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a billion-dollar country.&#x201d;<br> <br>The overtaxed and -governed 21st century reader may wince at the knowledge that the hero of these pages was an architect of the modern American state&#x2014;certainly, his biographer does. However, Reed did not knowingly set out to create Leviathan. He wanted not a big government but a functional one. He opposed what he took to be unwarranted federal intrusion into private matters, including big business, even though&#x2014;to a degree&#x2014;that business owed its bigness to the tariffs that the Republicans erected to protect it from foreign competition. In middle age, Reed found the time to teach himself French, but he stopped short at reading Frederic Bastiat, the French economist who demonstrated the compelling logic of free trade. The truth is that economics was not the czar&#x2019;s strongest suit&#x2014;then, again, it has rarely been Congress&#x2019;.<br> <br>Burning bright through the full length of Reed&#x2019;s congressional years was the question of what to do about money. Alexander Hamilton had defined the dollar in 1792 as a weight of silver (371� grains) or of gold (24� grains). Most of Reed&#x2019;s contemporaries agreed that the law meant what it said. Money must be intrinsically valuable, worth its weight, or something close to its weight, in one of the two precious metals. Paper money was acceptable only so far as it was freely exchangeable into the real McCoy. Let the government just print up dollar bills, as it had done during the American Revolution and again, under Abraham Lincoln, in the Civil War, and inflationary chaos would descend.<br> <br>In the final quarter of the 19th century, not a few Americans would have welcomed inflation with open arms. Falling prices were the norm; on average during Reed&#x2019;s political career, they fell by a little less than 2 percent a year. For debtors, the decline was a tribulation. They had borrowed dollars, and they were bound to repay dollars, but the value of the dollars they owed was rising. Thanks to material progress itself, the cost of producing goods and services was falling. Steamships had displaced sail, the automobile was gaining on the horse, and the telegraph and telephone were providing a fair preview of the wonders of the Internet. In consequence, prices fell even faster than wages did. Many Americans profited in the bargain, though a vocal minority lost, and this angry cohort did not shrink from expressing its demand for cheaper and more abundant dollars. Silver was a cheaper metal than gold, and paper was cheaper than either. Let money, therefore, argued the populists, be fashioned out of these common materials, the better to serve a growing nation and not incidentally lighten the debtor&#x2019;s load. For most of his public life, Reed took the opposite side of the argument. Supporting the gold standard, he contended that a stable, value-laden dollar best served the interests of all, wage-earners not least.<br> <br>As pro-inflation sentiment was rife in Maine, Reed maintained his hard-money view at some political risk to himself. He hewed consistently to gold until the mid-1890s, when the monetary battle was raging hottest. And then, to some of his friends&#x2019; despair, he casually indicated a preference for bimetallism, the monetary system under which gold and silver cohabitated (and in which gold was likely to be driven from circulation by the cheaper, and cheapening, alternative metal). To uncompromising gold-standard partisans, Speaker Reed suddenly seemed to go soft when he most needed to stand tall.<br> <br>Reed&#x2019;s mordant sense of humor was oddly out of phase with his upbeat view of the human condition. Unlike his friend Mark Twain, he was prepared to contend that reason was on its way to banishing war, purifying religion and eradicating poverty. For Reed, there was no bygone Arcadia; always, the best was yet to come.<br> <br>But not until he took matters into his own hands was there anything on Capitol Hill to resemble the ingenuity of Thomas Edison or Alexander Graham Bell. Until what were known as the Reed rules took force in 1890, the House was hostage to its own willful minority. If those members chose to obstruct, they would simply refuse to answer their names when the clerk called the roll. In sufficient numbers, sitting mute, they could stymie the House, which, under the Constitution, requires a quorum to function. Present bodily, they were absent procedurally.<br> <br>So for weeks on end, the main order of business might consist of parliamentary fencing and the droning repetition of roll calls, each absorbing 20 or 25 unedifying minutes. The 50th Congress, either notorious or celebrated for its inactivity (depending on one&#x2019;s politics), contributed 13 million words to the Congressional Record on the way to no greater legislative achievement than the institution of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. By contrast, the 36th Congress, as recently as 1859&#x2013;61, while debating war and peace, union and secession, freedom and slavery, had uttered just four million.<br> <br>Reed, elected Speaker for the first time in the 51st Congress, transformed the House by declaring those members present who were actually in the House chamber, whether or not they chose to acknowledge that fact by opening their mouths. Democrats excoriated him for doing so, their rage compounded by Reed&#x2019;s seeming imperturbability under fire. Not that they were alone in their disapproval. The voters, deciding that Reed had overreached, handed the House Republicans (though not Reed himself) a lopsided defeat in the congressional elections of 1892. By and by, Reed lived to see both himself and his rules vindicated, the Democrats themselves coming grudgingly to adopt them in 1894.<br> <br>Reed, a first-term congressman at the age of 37, had seen something of the world as Maine legislator, attorney general and Portland city solicitor. His political education continued in Congress with service on the commission to investigate the crooked presidential election of 1876. Each party had attempted to steal it, the Republicans finally out-filching the Democrats. Reed, as partisan a politician as they came even in that partisan age, distinguished himself in the investigation by bringing to light Democratic malfeasance while explaining away (or trying to) Republican offenses.<br> <br>Reed held sacred the right of majority rule. Especially did he hold that right dear, as a journalist of the time dryly remarked, when he agreed with the majority. But the majority and Speaker Reed finally parted company in 1898 over the administration&#x2019;s program to add to American possessions in the Caribbean and the Pacific. From the Speaker&#x2019;s chair, he engaged in his rearguard actions against the war. Holding up the Hawaiian annexation measure, for instance, he refused recognition for the members&#x2019; pet hometown appropriation measures on the grounds that &#x201c;the money is needed for the Malays,&#x201d; or&#x2014;concerning a proposed Philadelphia Commercial Museum&#x2014;&#x201c;This seems like a great waste of money. We could buy 15,000 naked Sulus with that.&#x201d;<br> <br>Reed was as prone to error as the next mortal legislator, but he was inoculated against humbug. The language of McKinley&#x2019;s aggressive foreign policy brought out what may seem now, with a century&#x2019;s perspective, the best in him. &#x201c;It is sea power which is essential to every splendid people,&#x201d; declaimed Henry Cabot Lodge, a close friend of Reed&#x2019;s&#x2014;and of Roosevelt&#x2019;s too&#x2014;in the Senate during the run-up to war. Said Reed, simply and winningly, &#x201c;Empire can wait.&#x201d;<br> <br>� 2011 James Grant</p><h2>Art of the Japanese Postcard: Masterpieces fom the Leonard A. Lauder Collection</h2><p>From the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century, Japan was a vital world center for postcard art. More than just casual mail pieces, these postcards were often designed by prominent artists and had a visual impact that belied their modest format. Remarkably beautiful examples of graphic design in their own right, they also recorded the shifting definitions of &#x201c;East&#x201d; and &#x201c;West&#x201d; at a time when such European currents as Art Nouveau began to show up in Japanese visual productions. <i>Art of the Japanese Postcard</i> presents 300 full-color examples of these cards, culled from the vast Leonard A. Lauder Collection. They are astonishing not only for their beauty and the quality of their printing, but also for the insight they provide into contemporary Japanese artistic practices--insights not relayed in standard histories that focus on painting and sculpture--as well as for the fluid interplay of European and Japanese modes. Authoritative essays by leading scholars of Japanese art and culture, plus a statement by the collector himself, highlight the design, development, and cultural function of these rarely studied, but highly influential and visually exciting, expressions of graphic genius.</p><p>Anne Nishimura Morse is Curator of Japanese Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, USA.

Hart Crane, prodigiously gifted and tragically doom-eager, was the American peer of Shelley, Rimbaud, and Lorca. Born in Garrettsville, Ohio, on July 21, 1899, Crane died at sea on April 27, 1932, an apparent suicide. A born poet, totally devoted to his art, Crane suffered his warring parents as well as long periods of a hand-to-mouth existence. He suffered also from his honesty as a homosexual poet and lover during a period in American life unsympathetic to his sexual orientation. Despite much critical misunderstanding and neglect, in his own time and in ours, Crane achieved a superb poetic style, idiosyncratic yet central to American tradition. His visionary epic, <em>The Bridge</em>, is the most ambitious and accomplished long poem since Walt Whitman's <em>Song of Myself</em>. Marc Simon's text is accepted as the most authoritative presentation of Hart Crane's work available to us. For this centennial edition, Harold Bloom, who was introduced to poetry by falling in love with Crane's work while still a child, has contributed a new introduction.</p><p>The Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University, Harold Bloom (b. 1930) has been hailed as &#x201c;one of our greatest living literary critics&#x201d; (Los Angeles Times).Crane's poetry has been a touchstone for me, and remains central to a fully imaginative understanding of American literature. -- <i>Harold Bloom</i></p><h2>Astro Boy, Vol. 3</h2><p>A timeless comics and animation classic, Osamu Tezuka' <i>Astro Boy</i> is still going strong nearly half a century after its creation, and Dark Horse brings Tekuza's original <i>Astro Boy</i> manga to America for the first time in an English-language edition. In the novel-length "The Greatest Robot on Earth," a wealthy sultan creates a giant robot to become the ruler of all other robots on Earth. But in order for that to happen, he must defeat the seven most powerful robots in the world, including Astro Boy, who must have his horsepower raised from 100,000 to 1,000,000 to face the challenge! And his sister, Uran, also flies in to lend a helping hand! Plus, in "Mad Machine," Professor Fuller invents a device that causes other machines to go berserk, and Astro Boy has to save the day!<br><br><b>This volume contains the following stories:</b><br>The Greatest Robot on Earth<br>Mad Machine</p><p>For those unfamiliar with Tezuka, Japan's manga master, the first English translation of the original Astro Boy series will be a revelation, both for its inventive charm and for its surprising sophistication. In "The Greatest Robot on Earth," the novel-length first story of this third volume in the series, the eponymous hero is one of seven robots being targeted by a crazy sultan intent on declaring his own robot, Pluto, the greatest in the world. Pluto dispatches his competitors with ease, but Astro Boy is a robot of a different order. He's the size and shape of a little boy, with spirit and spunk to match, and also has searchlight eyes, jet rockets in his feet and an atomic engine for a heart. This is a pre-digital, 1950s Cold War vision of modernity. Astro Boy must open his chest when he wants to check the time, and the threat of an arms race haunts the story, but Tezuka's generous characterizations give this story a timeless relevance. These robots might disintegrate into piles of screws and bolts, but like humans, they're capable of pride, affection and even a kind of love. Operating out of a steadfast loyalty, they are undone by the greed of the humans who created them. The clean, bold lines of Tezuka's remarkably efficient artwork complement his dynamic storytelling, proving the artist equally adept at capturing nuances in expressions and the explosive action of fight sequences. Entertaining and beautifully executed, this, along with the other pocket-sized editions in the series, is destined to become a classic. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Plains Warrior: Chief Quanah Parker and the Comanches</h2><p>A biography of the legendary Comanche leader profiles the son of a white woman, who fiercely defended tribal lands against those who tried to seize them and who, after being moved with his people to a reservation, fought for the recognition and decent treatment of his tribe.</p><p>Grade 6-9?This biography is a throwback to the sensationalistic dime novel Westerns of the turn of the century. As much a recounting of Comanche/Texan warfare as a biography of the man who guided the Comanche transition from freedom to reservation life, the book is largely based on soldiers' memoirs and captivity accounts, which are noted for their frequent biases and misunderstanding of Native cultures. Author of many earlier titles on various military topics and battles, Marrin uses that perspective here. Beginning with the abduction of nine-year-old Cynthia Ann Parker, her adoption and subsequent marriage into the tribe, he then devotes nearly half of the book to various military activities in Texas, such as the formation of the Texas Rangers and daily life for the enlisted men. Interesting, perhaps, but peripheral to a biography of a Comanche leader. The second half of the book, beginning with Cynthia Ann's (now Naduah's) recapture by the Texans after 25 years, finally turns its focus back to the subject at hand, her son Quanah. But is almost too little too late. The constant use of inappropriate vocabulary (women are always "squaws"; men are always "braves," "warriors," or "chiefs"); inflammatory descriptions; and just plain inaccurate information make it difficult to recommend this title for purchase.?Lisa Mitten, University of Pittsburgh, PA<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 6^-10. Marrin's fine new history is every bit as engrossing as his award-winning 1994 books <i>Unconditional Surrender</i> and <i>Virginia's General</i>. Following the same effective approach he used in those books, he melds biographical information about Comanche leader Quanah Parker with a balanced, carefully documented history of the relationship between settlers and the Comanches. Vivid descriptions of life on the Great Plains, compelling anecdotes, and lavish use of black-and-white photographs provide a strong sense of time and place as well as the personalities involved in the struggle to settle the Southwest. Marrin's evenhanded analyses of U.S. policy toward Native American peoples and of Quanah Parker's battles to ensure the survival of the Comanches will generate much discussion and can be used to introduce units on the Indian Wars. The text is so smoothly written that relevant chapters can easily be read aloud in class, and chapter notes and an extensive bibliography will allow students to pursue their research further. Recommend this title to American history buffs and to teens who have read Carolyn Meyer's <i>Where the Broken Heart Still Beats</i> (1992), the story of Quanah Parker's mother, Cynthia Ann, who was kidnapped by Comanches in 1836 and eventually married a Comanche chief. <i>Chris Sherman</i></p><h2>Language Smarts Level B Workbook - Reading, Writing, Grammar, and Punctuation for Grade 1</h2><p>This fun, colorful 352-page book can be used as a textbook or a comprehensive workbook with your textbook to teach reading, writing, grammar, and punctuation skills and concepts that students are expected to know in first grade.

Within its walls, potentially dangerous social forces might be tamed, securing the fulfilling life to which postwar women and men aspired. <i>Homeward Bound</i> tells the story of domestic containment - how it emerged, how it affected the lives of those who tried to conform to it, and how it unraveled in the wake of the Vietnam era's assault on Cold War culture, when unwed mothers, feminists, and &#x201d;secular humanists&#x201d; became the new &#x201d;enemy.&#x201d; This revised and updated edition includes the latest information on race, the culture wars, and current cultural and political controversies of the post-Cold War era.</p><p><b>Elaine Tyler May</b> is Professor of American Studies and History at the University of Minnesota.

"Clever Ashik" is similar to the riddle-solving "Clever Gretchen" and the wish-granting "Magic Saddlebag" is like Jack's magic tablecloth in "Jack and the Northwest Wind." Other tales are more culture specific, such as "Monkey and the River Dragon" from China or "A Rainbow in Silk" from Uzbekistan. Gilchrist's writing is bland, showing little variation as she moves from people to people. Mistry's gouache paintings illuminate the costumes, architecture, and terrain along the way.

Now in Spanish, Tacky is perfect for children learning Spanish and for Spanish-speaking children.<br></p><p>Helen Lester and Lynn Munsinger have been together through thick and thin since first publishing The Wizard, the Fairy, and the Magic Chicken in 1983. They have collaborated on the hilarious Tacky the Penguin series and many other wildly funny and popular titles, including the award-winning Hooway for Wodney Wat. Helen Lester is a full-time writer who makes her home in Pawling, New York, and Lynn Munsinger is a full-time illustrator living in Massachusetts.PreSchool-Grade 2-Taky the Penguin is noticeably different from his fellow birds. Where they are graceful, elegant, courteous, and adorable, Taky is disheveled, frumpy, clumsy, and exuberant. One would think that this would lead to all sorts of problems, but it doesn't. Instead, while his elegant peers quake behind an ice floe, Tacky exhibits all of his boisterous, strange behavior and scares away some hunters. Sometimes, different is good. First published in English in 1990, this popular character appears in several other Houghton Mifflin titles (e.g., Three Cheers for Taky, 1996, Taky in Trouble, 1998 and most recently Taky and the Emperor, 2000), which have not yet been translated into Spanish.

This is history told by people who lived it, on the factory floors and in executive offices, their voices ringing through a narrative that has all the heroes and villains and epic sweep of a Steinbeck novel. For more than a century after Dr. Benjamin Franklin Goodrich came to town, in 1870, Akron, Ohio was the rubber capital of the world. The city prospered along with the tire factories, becoming a model for Middle America&#39;s industrial success. Its people worked in the rubber shops and lived in neighborhoods fostered by companies like Goodyear and Firestone. Even the air they breathed was heavy with the odors of rubber. But by the 1980s, most of the rubber industry had gone south, first the plants and then the company headquarters, a result of stubbornness in the union ranks, intransigence in the corporate boardrooms, and takeovers by foreign competitors. Akron began an awkward metamorphosis from a stronghold of blue-collar labor to a research and development center, finding its new identity in the broader fields of polymer science and technology.</p><p>David Giffels is a staff writer for the Akron Beacon Journal. A native of Akron, Giffels completed B.A.s in English and Mass Media and an M.A. in English from The University of Akron.Its tire-manufacturing jobs have disappeared, and the familiar names of companies formerly headquartered there now belong to foreign owners. But Akron, Ohio, continues to be known as "the rubber capital of the world." Although its "Big Four" tire companies have been profiled individually, no thorough story of Akron and its once vital and thriving tire and rubber industry has ever been told before. This history of Akron's people and its commerce, which was originally published in Akron's <i>Beacon Journal</i> as a weekly series beginning in spring 1996 and running for a year, is spiritedly told with affection by two of the newspaper's staff writers. Love and Giffels recount a tale of struggle, survival, and loss, showing how the impact of the Depression, World War II, and the decline of manufacturing was magnified in this one-industry town. Their story is also one of rebirth as the University of Akron has become a growing center for polymer research. Richly illustrated with photographs from the newspaper archives. <i>David Rouse</i></p><h2>Started Early, Took My Dog</h2><p>With Dickensian brilliance, Kate Atkinson creates plots peopled with unlikely heroes and villains.<br><br>It's a day like any other for security chief Tracy Waterhouse, until she makes a purchase she hadn't bargained for.

All three characters learn that the past is never history and that no good deed goes unpunished.</p><p><br><strong>Kate Atkinson's <i>Started Early</i> Playlist</strong> <br> <p>I always make a compilation tape for Jackson for each book. I find it&#x2019;s rather like a meditation, something I come back to on a regular basis when I&#x2019;m writing because in some mysterious way it reminds me of the essence of each particular book. He, and I, like country music but that&#x2019;s quite a broad church. Sometimes it&#x2019;s apparent to me why I&#x2019;ve chosen certain tracks and at other times I&#x2019;m not at all sure of the reason. There are a lot of songs about dead mothers and orphaned children for <em>Case Histories</em> and <em>When Will There Be Good News</em>, and more than a few about death and heaven in <em>Started Early</em>. (Jackson&#x2019;s taste is strictly on the melancholic side.) At the moment I&#x2019;m writing a book that begins in 1910 and goes through the Second World War so just now I&#x2019;m listening to music from the Twenties and Thirties, rather odd and not entirely to my taste. I&#x2019;m looking forward to Glenn Miller and the Andrew Sisters--not Jackson&#x2019;s taste at all! <em>--Kate Atkinson</em></p> <p><strong>Listen to the playlist</strong></p> <br><br> <strong>Author One-on-One: Kate Atkinson and Lee Child</strong> <br> <p>In this Amazon exclusive, we brought together authors Kate Atkinson and Lee Child and asked them to interview each other.</p> <p><strong>Lee Child:</strong> This is the fourth Jackson Brodie book. It's starting to look suspiciously like a series! What brought you back this time?</p> <p><strong>Kate Atkinson:</strong> I never intended to write more than the first one -- which was <i>Case Histories</i> -- but I wrote it so quickly -- which was highly unusual for me -- that I somehow felt as if I hadn't finished with the form and the characters. And then it became the 'power of three' and I thought "one more" and then I found I had unfinished business for Jackson and it became four. I honestly don't know how that happened. There is something seductive about the shape of a detective novel, or at any rate of using a detective in a novel, because it gives you a ready-- made dynamic and a reason for introducing characters to whom interesting things happen as opposed to, say, starting with a whole load of people in a bank or an office and thinking so what are their stories, and what's going to happen to them? (Although, even as I'm writing that, I'm thinking oh, actually that sounds quite intriguing).</p> <p><strong>Child:</strong> Your career so far shows you're not afraid to write whatever you choose. It's as if you've been in and out of several different rooms in the house. Is that fun?</p> <p><strong>Atkinson:</strong> Yes! I get bored quite easily but also there are so many ways of writing out there to explore. To run with the house analogy -- I love houses and there are so many lovely ones that I'll never have a chance to live in because life is short and so is money. It's the same with different styles and genres of writing. I hope before I die I manage to write a romantic novel (because I never write any kind of romance) and I would love to be able to write a children's book, but I think they are the most challenging of all.</p> <p><strong>Child:</strong> Is it easier to write the Brodie books than the others? Or harder?</p> <p><strong>Atkinson:</strong> I found the Brodie books easy to begin with, and then very difficult to finish. I haven't actually finished with him yet but at the moment he's taking a holiday somewhere restful. I found the new book really hard but I think I'd just run out of steam with the character. I'm writing something completely different at the moment and it's amazing how much energy I have for it and what a relief it feels! I think the next time I re-visit Jackson it will be with that same kind of enthusiasm -- and he (and I) will be all the better for having taken a break from each other!</p> <p><strong>Child:</strong> You write about Yorkshire with a certain exasperated affection. You were born there, right?</p> <p><strong>Atkinson:</strong> I am actually a patron of the Yorkshire Tourist Board! I think it's true of everyone in exile -- I live in Edinburgh -- no matter how mild the form, that you have a longing for what you have left behind.</p> <p>I think the older you get the stronger that is -- not so much nostalgia, but a feeling that your heart is in another place. I may be kidding myself there and, like Jackson, there are certain parts of Yorkshire that I would never want to re-visit, but like him I think there are places in North Yorkshire that do mark it out as God's Own county. (I don't know why Yorkshire people are so fervently patriotic about their county!) My whole family is settled in Scotland so that kind of prevents me from moving back although I dream about that little cottage in the Dales, Aga in the kitchen, sheep bleating outside the window...</p> <br><br> <p>(Photo of Kate Atkinson � Martin Hunter; photo of Lee Child � Sigrid Estrada;)</p>KATE ATKINSON's most recent novel, <b>When Will There Be Good News?</b>, was voted Richard &amp; Judy Best Read of the Year.

Spunky, strong-willed, and too smart for her own good, Zippy Jarvis brought readers delight and joy. In She Got Up Off the Couch, Haven Kimmel invites us to rejoin the quirky and hilarious Jarvis family saga. Zippy is growing up and struggling with both her hair and her distaste for shoes. But this memoir strikes a deeper and more emotional chord, as now Kimmel shines the spotlight on her remarkable mother, Delonda. Courageous and steadfast, Delonda finally realized that she could change her life, and she got up off the funky couch in the den, bought a beat-up flower power VW bug (and then learned to drive it), and went back to school, which gave her the chance to gain both financial independence and, at long last, self-respect.A true pleasure for old fans and new ones alike, She Got Up Off the Couch is a gorgeous encapsulation of an innocent time when a child didn&#39;t understand that her mother was depressed or felt stifled, but just noted on her way out the door that Delonda was a fixture in the living room. Kimmel captures the seminal moments of her mother&#39;s burgeoning empowerment with the full strength of her distinctive, deft storytelling, and with the overflowing sense of humor that made A Girl Named Zippy a favorite of readers everywhere.</p><p>Haven Kimmel's memoir <i>She Got Up Off the Couch</i> might have been called <i>The Further Adventures of Zippy</i>, since it picks up where her bestselling <i>A Girl Named Zippy</i> left off, and is reeled out in much the same vein. The person who got up off the couch is Zippy's mother, Delonda, who for years sat on the titular sofa, ate, read, and watched TV until she weighed 268 pounds and life was nearly unbearable. You would never know the bad parts from Haven Kimmel, who always concentrates on the bright side, even though she lived in a house without heat, food, indoor plumbing, a dependable water supply or even a modicum of cleanliness. Kimmel loves her parents inordinately, even at their most unlovable. <p> Delonda takes a College Entrance exam, passes it and enrolls at Ball State, where she completes a degree in two years, goes on for a Master's and gets a job as a high school teacher. That sounds fairly straightforward but it wasn't easy. Bob Jarvis, Delonda's husband and Zippy's father, gave her no help at all; in fact, he ridiculed her and ignored her progress. Eventually, he found someone else while Delonda was busy reclaiming her life. We could read this as a tale of the times, where a woman takes charge of herself, loses 120 pounds and, against all odds, gains an education and a livelihood. It is all of that, and more. </p><p> Life in Mooreland, Indiana, in the 1970s is not very exciting, but Zippy finds wonder everywhere and often laughed until she "tipped right over." There is an unquenchable spirit in the girl, and then in the woman, that keeps popping up despite a very sketchy upbringing. The neighbors fed and bathed her, she wore the same pair of pants to school every day for an entire school year--without benefit of laundry. Her brother and sister lit out at the first chance they had--though Melinda ends up only a few blocks away and becomes another safe port for Zippy. She is a victim of benign neglect, not malice or meanness. </p><p> Her tales of church camp, days with her friends, driving with her Dad, going to a play with her Mother, her love for her niece and nephew and her discovery that her Dad is having an affair are all told in typical Zippy-style: they are humorous, poignant, exuberant, and often breathless. Stay tuned: this book ends when Zippy is only thirteen. Hopefully there's more to come. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p><b>Haven Kimmel</b> is the author of <i>The Used World</i>, <i>She Got Up Off the Couch</i>, <i>Something Rising (Light and Swift)</i>, <i>The Solace of Leaving Early</i>, and <i>A Girl Named Zippy</i>.

This time he's tracking down tax fraud among the bestiarii, the slaughterers, and the lanistae, the suppliers of the gladiators and animals who provide the executions, spectacles, and entertainment for the Roman masses. <p>Hoisted by his own tarnished petard, Falco is unwillingly partnered with his ex-boss Anacrites, Rome's chief spy, but that's the least of his problems; his investigation has hardly begun when he finds himself in the tunnels under the arena with a lion named Leonidas--a man-killer who may or may not have been switched with a tamer beast for a private party meant to impress a wealthy Senator's mistress.</p><p> While Leonidas presents no immediate threat to Falco--the king of the jungle is quite dead--the circumstances of the beast's demise lead Falco to ponder a connection between a murderous feud that seems to have broken out in the ranks of the lanistae and the lucrative contracts soon to be let by the emperor for his magnificent new amphitheater. And when the most popular gladiator in Rome is killed--not in the arena, as might be expected, but while sleeping in his own bed--Falco and his patrician lover Helena take passage to Tripoli to track down the perpetrator. Along the way, they attempt to solve a domestic crisis involving Helena's youngest brother, who seems to be right in the middle of the African connection between the murders of man and beast, as well as the feud between two powerful lanistae. And there's still another reason to embark on a journey to the Dark Continent--the search for an extinct variety of wild garlic, which could make Falco a wealthy man and which ends with a hilarious denouement. </p><p>As usual, Davis serves up a generous helping of history, a raffish band of minor characters, a charming love story, and surprisingly relevant commentary on the nature of the bureaucracy, politics, and chicanery among the rich and famous. <i>Two for the Lions</i> promises--and delivers--a treat for the author's many fans, and a terrific introduction to his new ones. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Winner of the first ever Ellis Peters Historical Dagger Award. <p>Falco finds himself following a trail that leads from Rome to the blood-soaked sand of a North African gladiator arena.</p> <p><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p></p><h2>The Private Passion of Jackie Kennedy Onassis: Portrait of a Rider</h2><p><p>In <strong>The Private Passion of Jackie Kennedy Onassis</strong>, <strong>Vicky Moon</strong> illuminates just how vital a role horses played throughout Jackie's often tumultuous life. Jackie's mother propped her up on a horse when she was just a year old, and throughout her childhood Jackie turned to her pony Buddy to distract her from the stress of her parents' precarious marriage. As a woman struggling under the intense pressures of her role as First Lady, riding a horse through the countryside was a much-needed tonic. And later in her life, as a mourning widow and then a reluctant celebrity, riding offered Jackie peace and privacy. Whether cantering up and down the emerald hills of Ireland, galloping through the woods in New Jersey, racing cross-country, or taking long, quiet rides with her children down the dirt trails of Virginia's hunt country, Jackie's lifelong passion for horses was a mainstay during difficult years, a refuge from a life in the limelight, and a constant source of joy.</p><p>Now, in addition to the elegant, stunning images from every stage of her life -- photographs taken while out riding to the hounds, at the steeplechase with Jack, with Caroline on her pony -- Jackie's story unfolds through Moon's fresh and engaging narrative, sprinkled with anecdotes and memories from those who knew Jackie not only as one of the most admired women in the world, but simply as a graceful and talented horsewoman.</p></p><p><p>Vicky Moon is the author of <strong>The Official Middleburg Life Cookbook</strong>; <strong>The Middleburg Mystique: A Peek Inside the Gates of Middleburg, Virginia</strong>; <strong>Best Dressed Southern Salads</strong>; and <strong>A Sunday Horse: Inside the Grand Prix Show Jumping Tour</strong>. She has also written for the <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>People</em>, <em>Town and Country</em>, and <em>House and Garden</em>. She lives in Middleburg, Virginia, with her husband, sportswriter Leonard Shapiro, and her son.</p>It could be argued that every aspect of Jackie Kennedy Onassis&#x2019;s life has been examined ad nauseum, but Moon appears to have struck upon an overlooked treasure in this tribute to the former First Lady&#x2019;s lifelong love of horses. Moon, the author and founder, editor and publisher of The Middleburg Life (a newspaper for Virginia horse country), tells the story of Jackie&#x2019;s passion for horses from age five through the end of her life. Jackie began riding very young and by the age of five participated in the East Hampton Horse Show. The photos of Jackie with her mother and father, Janet and Jack Bouvier, and on her beloved Chestnut mare, Danseuse, hint at the beauty and poise that would become her trademarks. Like her mother, Jackie grew into an accomplished equestrian. And Moon argues that riding brought the First Lady the solace and solitude that she craved; she would return to her horses again and again at moments of joy and sorrow. While her husband listened to Marilyn Monroe sing her breathy rendition of Happy Birthday at Madison Square Garden in New York, Jackie was at a horse show. After his assassination, horseback riding became "a significant part of her recuperative routine." Divided into short sections, the writing here is easy to read and conversational rather than historical, and the abundant photos speak volumes: Jackie riding with her children, Caroline and John; ponies on the White House Lawn with John F. Kennedy and the Secret Service; Jackie carefree in formal horse attire. Moon has constructed a must-have for horse lovers but also a touching tribute to Onassis; one of the few that the very private woman might have enjoyed herself.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A screenwriter by training, Massey has lived in London and Los Angeles. He currently lives with his wife and three children&nbsp;in Australia.&nbsp;<p></p><p>PREFACE</p><p>There&#x2019;s a Mickey Mouse clock hanging in my kitchen, probably still ticking. I&#x2019;ve taken quite a bit of stick about it over the years. Mickey Mouse on its face, with his big open smile and wide eyes, walking in place with boundless joy and enthusiasm, surrounded by numbers. My friend Christy used to shake his head when he&#x2019;d see it. &#x201c;The clock&#x2019;s got to go, Paddy,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say. It&#x2019;s probably not the right clock to have on your wall when you&#x2019;re forty-two years old; but for me, Mickey&#x2019;s the patron saint of getting out of the soup with your spirit intact. No matter what&#x2019;s thrown at him, no matter how hairy things get, his happy demeanor never fades. He walks away with a whistle and smile every time.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been to quite a few funerals in my time. More than most people, having been around the trade all my life. My father was a coffin maker for one of Dublin&#x2019;s largest undertaking firms, and I followed him into it, ending up making the arrangements and running the funerals. I always liked listening to the eulogies delivered after the Mass was finished and the congregation was settled back into their pews waiting for a few words. A few years ago, I stood at the back of the church with my boss, Frank Gallagher, listening to a guy talk about his brother, who&#x2019;d died at the age of twenty-eight in a drowning accident. Everyone was pretty cut up over the loss, but this guy, beleaguered though he was, had a glow about him. Probably a few years older than his deceased brother, he stood at the pulpit with his John Lennon glasses and long hair. He told the church that we were all in a dream and that his brother had woken up. This misery of a gig called life is just a dream from which we all eventually awaken, he said. Nobody gets left behind. Even the most horrible dreams end. And I never forgot it.</p><p>My life had become pretty miserable towards the end&#x2014;a nightmare, if you like. I&#x2019;d gone from being a contented forty-year-old with a pregnant French wife to a disillusioned widower with nothing to wake up for except other people&#x2019;s funerals. My wife, Eva, died of a brain hemorrhage while standing in line at the supermarket in her thirty-sixth year. What do we do with that one, Mickey? Whistling and smiling didn&#x2019;t cut it. After that, enthusiasm seemed impossible.</p><p>For a guy who wanted nothing more than to escape his grief, I probably had the worst job in the world. But I buried myself in it, nonetheless, if you&#x2019;ll forgive my saying so. I worked the week. Seven days. Frank Gallagher didn&#x2019;t want to give it to me at first. It wasn&#x2019;t the money&#x2014;he&#x2019;d have had to give it to somebody&#x2014;he was worried about me running myself into the ground. But I assured him it was what I wanted. I needed to help other people deal with their grief so I could escape from mine. For two years I tried this, until I couldn&#x2019;t sleep anymore. Until I arrived at the last few days of my life. Until a set of circumstances so outlandish, so surreal, and so dangerous could only result in one thing: my death. My awakening from the dream. And my subsequent funeral. And cremation. And all the tears and regret that go with it.</p><p>But not from me. I&#x2019;m gone beyond it, where all the madness, the chaos, the seemingly endless pain is behind me, and I find myself in a place of tremendous peace and understanding, of rest. And from this perfect, still place, I have total recall of my last days. I remember every single moment.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Monday</p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>The insomnia had become chronic. It was so bad that it had dragged me from delirium and hallucinations to sudden lucid periods of prolonged focus and back again. I didn&#x2019;t spend much time in bed those last few months, but when I did, in the hope of sleeping, my thoughts were always with Eva. Sometimes I&#x2019;d even be able to conjure up her image. I&#x2019;d cling to the moment as I&#x2019;d study her sitting on the edge of the bed beside me. The chestnut brown of her irises. The little twitching of her nose when she smiled. The sexy gap between her front teeth. The curves of her shoulders and breasts. I&#x2019;d want to sigh deeply and never breathe again. Then, when I&#x2019;d reach out to touch her, she&#x2019;d disappear.</p><p>The only detail that remained was my feelings. And memories. But no such luck this morning. Nothing for me to fix on but my desperate longing.</p><p>Mondays had ceased to punctuate the beginning of the week for me, as I&#x2019;d been working solidly for six months now. Even at night, I&#x2019;d take the calls&#x2014;death didn&#x2019;t keep banker&#x2019;s hours&#x2014;and out I&#x2019;d go into the darkness of Dublin, past the stinking Liffey, the drug dealers and prostitutes, the drinkers and poets, to the freshly bereaved. Sometimes there&#x2019;d be a corpse for me to take away, other times not. But every time there&#x2019;d be death. The tapestry of days and nights, and weeks and months, had blurred together into one gray grieving mess of funeral after funeral after funeral, each one a secret candle of remembrance for Eva.</p><p>I put on my overcoat in the hallway and checked myself in the mirror. Gray suit, blue shirt, navy tie. More and more, when I looked in the mirror now, I saw my father staring back at me. Shay Buckley had dropped the body at sixty-three&#x2014;car crash: quick exit. I&#x2019;d inherited his twinkling green eyes and his dimples, but it was the grayness in the hair that had me seeing his ghost in the mirror this morning. He&#x2019;d had two streaks of light gray running the length of either side of his otherwise black mop of hair since he was in his thirties, which won him the moniker of the Badger. On my fortieth birthday, I thought I&#x2019;d escaped the same fate, but in the last couple of years, the little flecks of gray above my ears have grown into more pronounced lines continuing down to the back of my neck. But nobody calls me the Badger, probably in deference to my father.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>I MANEUVERED SLOWLY down through the traffic in my brown Toyota Camry past the redbrick houses on Crumlin Road, past the drifting pairings of strung-out junkies with their sunken eyes and Borstal marks, and the unemployed builders and plumbers outside the job center, dragging the last from their cigarettes. Further down, over the Grand Canal, past the rusted swings and graffitied walls of Dolphin House, I watched a three-legged mongrel hobbling after a bearded old man while I remembered my father and the little tricks he&#x2019;d taught me. My mother died when I was only four, taken out by cancer, so it had just been ourselves, and we were extra close. Back when Gallagher&#x2019;s made their own boxes, Shay had been the chief coffin maker. He&#x2019;d started out as a carpenter, but ended up finding his groove in Gallagher&#x2019;s loft and worked there until his death. He was the rock of calm in my life. The world could collapse around him and he wouldn&#x2019;t blow his cool, having a veritable tool kit for any situation he found himself in.</p><p>When I was seven, I broke my arm after falling out of a tree. I remember writhing in agony while gingerly cradling my crooked forearm and he sitting me down and looking me in the eye. &#x201c;Patrick,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I want you to focus while I tell you about something very important: Independent Channel 24.&#x201d; His calm was contagious. He had both my attention and curiosity.</p><p>&#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a place in your mind where the pain goes away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do I do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Listen to me. Your arm is broken, but you are not your arm, Patrick. Remove yourself from it. You have a sense of pain, but you are not your sense of pain.&#x201d;</p><p>Even back then, I figured my father was part druid. I held my arm, still feeling the pain, but my awareness was completely away from it now, centered instead on his words and where they were bringing me. &#x201c;Now, remove yourself from your body and observe this situation between us from another perspective.&#x201d; Shay had helped me when I was even younger to create an imaginary sanctuary I could retreat to for relaxing and healing, and in there, he&#x2019;d trained me to see myself objectively, to see the bigger picture that I was just a part of. For years after my mother had died, I&#x2019;d lay in bed at night while my father guided me down twenty-one imaginary steps to the sanctuary we created together, a tranquil place, and I&#x2019;d watch myself down there, removed from my body so I could see myself safe in fields of barley under the shelter of old sycamore trees. Independent Channel 24 was more radical, yet still an extension of what he&#x2019;d already taught me, so I could quite easily project my imagined self to a place where I could watch myself beside him.</p><p>He must have noticed a shift in me. &#x201c;Where are you now?&#x201d;</p><p>My sharpened and hungry focus was informed by two things: my extreme pain diminishing and my believing in my father. I nodded to a spot beside the branch I&#x2019;d fallen from. His eyes twinkled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve just accessed Independent Channel 24.&#x201d; There were other channels for other situations, I learned later, but it was number 24 that I had full understanding of at the age of seven.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>I DROVE THROUGH the open cast-iron gates of the head office in Uriel Street, in the Liberties&#x2014;the oldest part of Dublin. The building itself was Victorian, a robust example of the period with its solid walls made from Dolphin&#x2019;s Barn bricks&#x2014;the Irish wonder brick of the nineteenth century&#x2014;and its grand doorways and window frames painted ivy green. The bricks were practically black, having collected countless decades of soot and sulfur. Frank Gallagher had considered having them cleaned but figured in the end they were a nice reminder of what Dublin used to look like, and he&#x2019;d made sure the rest of the building was always immaculate, from the paint on the doors, window frames, and gates to the gold-leaf Gothic lettering of the Gallagher&#x2019;s sign. It was a sizable block, housing the two-story building that made up the offices and embalming room, a long row of stables that used to accommodate the horses the firm used back in the 1930s and &#x2019;40s, a gravel car park, and the garage and loft, which housed the fleet and coffins, respectively.</p><p>Inside, Frank Gallagher was sitting behind the desk in the front office, writing. I sat down opposite him and checked the list of runners for the morning&#x2019;s work.</p><p>&#x201c;Anything doing?&#x201d; I asked. Frank pulled a sheet of paper off a notepad in front of him and handed it over.</p><p>&#x201c;The artist Michael Wright, dead in the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook. Cancer. His wife is waiting in their house on Pembroke Lane.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Always plenty of cancer to go round,&#x201d; I said, noting the address.</p><p>Frank sat back in his seat and considered me. We were the only two in the room.</p><p>&#x201c;How much sleep did you get last night?&#x201d;</p><p>The question made me smile; its mirthless quality wasn&#x2019;t lost on Frank.</p><p>&#x201c;Would you try sleeping tablets?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to medicate. Besides, I don&#x2019;t mind not sleeping.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to get a balance back in your life, Paddy. Working around the clock is not the answer.&#x201d; Frank got up from his chair. &#x201c;Have a cup of coffee with me before you go out to that family.&#x201d;</p><p>Apart from the engraving of nameplates for the coffins, there was little work done in the back office. It had only a wooden counter, some stools, a kettle and cups, and a door out to the yard, which was the main entrance for staff. Jack, a young driver who&#x2019;d been working with the firm for eighteen months, stood at the counter, drinking tea while reading the <i>Daily Star</i>. He was about a strawberry short of a punnet, but lived in his heart and had access to everyone else&#x2019;s as a result.</p><p>I sat on a stool while Frank went about getting the coffee together. As he did with everything else in his life, Frank insisted on what he considered to be the best, and in the case of coffee, it was French roast from Bewley&#x2019;s on Grafton Street, which Frank claimed had the best coffee in Dublin. He ground the beans prior to each serving in a little electric grinder, made the coffee extra strong, and served it black. As he focused on the coffee, I took a good look at him. Frank was in his sixties now and was to me the epitome of the perfect undertaker: always dressed somberly in beautifully tailored suits&#x2014;three-piece in the winter months, two-piece in the summer&#x2014;and always well groomed. He was the fairest man I&#x2019;d ever met, and was known for it throughout the trade. In all the time I knew him, he&#x2019;d never once veered from what he knew was the righteous path, and he demonstrated this in all aspects of his life. In fact, Frank was my external moral compass. If ever in a moral dilemma, I&#x2019;d need only ask myself one question: What would Frank do?</p><p>&#x201c;How does he do it?&#x201d; said Jack, shaking his head at the newspaper.</p><p>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; said Frank.</p><p>&#x201c;Vincent Cullen,&#x201d; said Jack, pointing to a picture of him outside the Four Courts. &#x201c;He got off again.&#x201d;</p><p>Frank smiled at me and got back to the coffee. It was no surprise that Vincent Cullen had got off. He was Dublin&#x2019;s most heavy-duty criminal and had a knack for avoiding prison, mostly due to very effective intimidation of witnesses and jury members. Jack, and a good portion of Ireland with him, loved to marvel at the antics of the Cullen brothers through the safe window of a newspaper.</p><p>Frank slid an espresso in front of me. I downed it in one and rose to my feet.</p><p>&#x201c;See you in church,&#x201d; I said.</p><p></p><p></p><p>TWO</p><p>Though the address was only a hop across town, I traversed a Georgian wonderland to get to the Wrights&#x2019; house, which was tucked away behind the landscaped lawns, wrought-iron railings, and manicured hedges of Wellington Road. There weren&#x2019;t as many pained expressions on this side of town as there were in Crumlin, and there was a wealth of stylish people with fine pedigrees and polished dreams, carrying their takeaway lattes under well-seasoned plane trees, gently swaying in an autumn that had only started undressing.</p><p>The same setting at nighttime wasn&#x2019;t so pretty. From Thursday through Sunday between nine at night and six in the morning, the city center took on the milieu of an open-air mental hospital. Every second or third shopfront on Grafton Street framed at least one splurge of vomit, and it was the same for the Georgian doorways on Leeson Street and Harcourt Street and around the walls of Trinity College. There were drunk people everywhere&#x2014;laughing, singing, shouting, fighting&#x2014;and thieves alive in the shadows. Even the buskers had to watch their money.</p><p>But by Monday morning, the madness receded, the only evidence being the last few standing revelers and the crusted vomit sneered at by the mocking light of day; the only witnesses, the slumbering homeless being woken from their cardboard beds by the nagging seagulls and choking fumes from the idling buses and gridlocked traffic.</p><p>I pressed the intercom button and waited in the lane. It was October and the wind still had a warmth to its breeze. I closed my eyes for a moment and listened to the sound of the leaves and dust swirling around me. It was so comforting that I considered curling up on the ground and falling asleep.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; came a female voice over the intercom. I opened my eyes and moved closer to the buzzer, any notions of sleep fast disappearing.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Wright, it&#x2019;s Paddy Buckley from Gallagher&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>The door in the wall vibrated.</p><p>I pushed it open and walked across a little stone garden to be met at the sliding doors by a woman dressed in a dark green cas...</p></p><h2>Wreck of the Carl D.: A True Story of Loss, Survival, and Rescue at Sea</h2><p><p><b>By the author of <i>Mighty Fitz</i>, the dramatic account of the sinking of the <i>Carl D.

Julie Nicoletta's perceptive text and Bret Morgan's striking photographs illuminate the austere beauty, regional variations, and functional and stylistic evolution of Shaker buildings over the course of two centuries, evoking a visual and literary survey of Shaker design and its impact on our culture at large. Despite the fact that Shaker communities are almost extinct, an appreciation for their legacy continues to grow. Architects, designers, curators, collectors, and an ever-widening public have sought inspiration in Shaker art and architecture. <em>The Architecture of the Shakers</em> is a book for all those who wish to learn more about these remarkable buildings and how the rich cultural legacy of the Shakers continues to resonate within them.</p><p><b>Julie Nicoletta</b> is a leading member of a new generation of scholars specializing in American vernacular architecture. Currently a professor of history at the University of Washington, Nicoletta holds a doctorate in art history from Yale University. <b>Bret Morgan</b> is a photographer with a special interest in the poetry of old buildings. His architectural and institutional clients include Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners, The Museum of Modern Art, and the Smithsonian. Morgan holds a Master of Architecture degree from Columbia University.Historian Nicoletta presents Shaker architecture as a function of the sect's spirituality, celibacy, and industriousness and examines its evolution from the beginnings of religious revivalism to the decline of Shakerism in the 20th century. The 22 communities, once bustling, have long since been abandoned (with the exception of Sabbathday Lake, Maine), and the author shows how the rise and fall of Shakerism influenced the construction and renovation of their structures. Nicoletta also discusses the effect outside influences had on Shaker architecture, especially as members began to leave the communities. This work is more substantive than Paul Rocheleau and June Sprigg's Shaker Built: The Form and Function of Shaker Architecture (LJ 2/1/95) because here Nicoletta focuses on how the different construction styles served the Shakers' unique lifestyle. And although he does not offer the plans that Herbert Schiffer included in Shaker Architecture (1979), Nicoletta presents color photographs of communities that have since been renovated. Highly recommended for public and academic libraries with strong Shaker or vernacular architecture collections.<br><i>Julie C.

His popular TV series brought whales, otters, and dolphins right into people&#x2019;s living rooms. Now, in this exciting picturebook biography, Dan Yaccarino introduces young readers to the man behind the snorkel.<br><br>From the first moment he got a glimpse of what lived under the ocean&#x2019;s waves, Cousteau was hooked. And so he set sail aboard the Calypso to see the sea. He and his team of scientists invented diving equipment and waterproof cameras. They made films and televisions shows and wrote books so they could share what they learned. The oceans were a vast unexplored world, and Cousteau became our guide. And when he saw that pollution was taking its toll on the seas, Cousteau became our guide in how to protect the oceans as well.</p><p>Dan Yaccarino is an internationally acclaimed author-illustrator with more than 30 books to his credit. He lives in New York City with his wife and two children.Yaccarino is best known for his whimsical animal characters, including some, such as Oswald the octopus, who now star in their own television series. Here he switches focus to a real-world, human hero: famed oceanographer Jacques Cousteau. The brief, evenly paced text, which includes a few direct quotes, describes Cousteau&#x2019;s lifelong fascination with the sea, filmmaking, and invention,&nbsp;beginning&nbsp;with&nbsp;depictions of the scientist as a young boy, tinkering with cameras and swimming in the ocean to recover from chronic illness. Rendered in gouache and airbrush, the playful illustrations evoke popular mid-twentieth-century patterns and shades&#x2014;a fitting reference to Cousteau&#x2019;s professional heyday. A few scenes seem to emphasize design over realistic depictions: undersea vessels, in particular, are indistinct shapes, and Cousteau himself often appears as a stylized figure. The fanciful, textured images give a sense of the sea&#x2019;s infinite swirl of life, though, and they are further grounded by the solid, straightforward words. Pair this energetic, inspiring biography with Jennifer Berne&#x2019;s Manfish (2008), another picture-book view of Cousteau&#x2019;s life and work.

RoBB<br>One</b></p><p>On a day kissed gently by summer, three thousand, seven hundred and sixty-one passengers cruised the New York Harbor on the Staten Island Ferry. Two of them had murder on their minds.<br>The other three thousand, seven hundred and fifty-nine aboard the bright orange ferry christened the Hillary Rodham Clinton were simply along for the ride. Most were tourists who happily took their vids and snaps of the retreating Manhattan skyline or that iconic symbol of freedom, the Statue of Liberty.<br>Even in 2060, nearly two centuries after she&#x2019;d first greeted hopeful immigrants to a new world, nobody beat &#x201c;The Lady.&#x201d;<br>Those who jockeyed for the best views munched on soy chips, sucked down tubes of soft drinks from the snack bars while the ferry chugged placidly along on calm waters under baby blue skies.<br>With the bold sun streaming, the scent of sunscreen mixed with the scent of water, many jammed the decks for the duration of the twenty-five-minute ride from Lower Manhattan to Staten Island. A turbo would have taken half the time, but the ferry wasn&#x2019;t about expediency. It was about tradition.<br>Most planned to get off at St. George, jam the terminal, then simply load back on again to complete the round trip. It was free, it was summer, it was a pretty way to spend an hour.<br>Some midday commuters, eschewing the bridges, the turbos, or the air trams, sat inside, out of the biggest crowds, and passed the time with their PPCs or &#x2019;links.<br>Summer meant more kids. Babies cried or slept, toddlers whined or giggled, and parents sought to distract the bored or fractious by pointing out the grand lady or a passing boat.<br>For Carolee Grogan of Springfield, Missouri, the ferry ride checked off another item on her Must Do list on the family vacation she&#x2019;d lobbied for. Other Must Dos included the top of the Empire State Building, the Central Park Zoo, the Museum of Natural History, St. Pat&#x2019;s, the Metropolitan Museum of Art (though she wasn&#x2019;t sure she&#x2019;d successfully harangue her husband and ten- and seven-year-old sons into that one), Ellis Island, Memorial Park, a Broadway show&#x2014;she didn&#x2019;t care which one&#x2014;and shopping on Fifth Avenue.<br>In the spirit of fairness, she&#x2019;d added on a ballgame at Yankee Stadium, and fully accepted she would have to wander the cathedral of Tiffany&#x2019;s alone while her gang hit the video heaven of Times Square.<br>At forty-three, Carolee was living a long-cherished dream. She&#x2019;d finally pushed, shoved and nagged her husband east of the Mississippi.<br>Could Europe be far behind?<br>When she started to take a snapshot of her &#x201c;boys,&#x201d; as she called Steve and their sons, a man standing nearby offered to take one of the whole family. Carolee happily turned over her camera, posed with her boys with the dignified lady of liberty behind them.<br>&#x201c;See.&#x201d; She gave her husband an elbow poke as they went back to looking out at the water. &#x201c;He was nice. Not all New Yorkers are rude and nasty.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Carolee, he was a tourist, just like us. He&#x2019;s probably from Toledo or somewhere.&#x201d; But he smiled when he said it. It was more fun to yank her chain than to admit he was having a pretty good time.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to ask him.&#x201d;<br>Steve only shook his head as his wife walked over to chat up the picture taker. It was so Carolee. She could&#x2014;and did&#x2014;talk to anyone anywhere about anything.<br>When she came back she offered Steve a smug smile. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s from Maryland, but,&#x201d; she added with a quick finger jab, &#x201c;he&#x2019;s lived in New York for almost ten years. He&#x2019;s going over to Staten Island to visit his daughter. She just had a baby. A girl. His wife&#x2019;s been staying with them the past few days to help out, and she&#x2019;s meeting him at the terminal. It&#x2019;s their first grandchild.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Did you find out how long he&#x2019;s been married, where and how he met his wife, who he voted for in the last election?&#x201d;<br>She laughed and gave Steve another poke.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thirsty.&#x201d;<br>She glanced down at her youngest. &#x201c;You know, me, too. Why don&#x2019;t you and I go get some drinks for everybody.&#x201d; She grabbed his hand and snaked her way through the people crowded on deck. &#x201c;Are you having a good time, Pete?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s pretty neat, but I really want to go see the penguins.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tomorrow, first thing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Can we get a soy dog?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Where are you putting them? You had one an hour ago.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They smell good.&#x201d;<br>Vacation meant indulgence, she decided. &#x201c;Soy dogs it is.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But I have to pee.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; As a veteran mother, she&#x2019;d scoped out the restrooms when they&#x2019;d boarded the ferry. Now she detoured to steer them toward the nearest facilities.<br>And, of course, since Pete mentioned it, now she had to pee. She pointed toward the men&#x2019;s room. &#x201c;If you get out first, you stand right here. You remember what the ferry staff looks like, the uniforms? If you need help, go right to one of them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mom, I&#x2019;m just going to pee.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, me, too. You wait for me here if you get out first.&#x201d;<br>She watched him go in, knowing full well he rolled his eyes the minute his back was to her. It amused her as she turned toward the women&#x2019;s room.<br>And saw the Out of Order sign.<br>&#x201c;Shoot.&#x201d;<br>She weighed her options. Hold it until Pete came out, then hold it some more while they got the dogs and drinks&#x2014;because he&#x2019;d whine and sulk otherwise&#x2014;then make her way to the other restroom.<br>Or . . . maybe she could just peek in. Surely not all the stalls were out of order. She only needed one.<br>She pushed open the door, hurried in. She didn&#x2019;t want to leave Pete alone for long.<br>She made the turn at the line of sinks, her mind on getting the provisions and squeezing back to the rail to watch Staten Island come into view.<br>She stopped dead, her limbs frozen in shock.<br>Blood, she thought, could only think, so much blood. The woman on the floor seemed bathed in it.<br>The man standing over the body held a still-dripping knife in one hand and a stunner in the other.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he said&#x2014;and, to her shocked mind, sounded sincere.<br>Even as Carolee sucked in the air to scream, took the first stumbling step back, he triggered the stunner.<br>&#x201c;Really very sorry,&#x201d; he said as Carolee fell to the floor.<br><br>Racing across New York Harbor in a turbo wasn&#x2019;t how Lieutenant Eve Dallas expected to spend her afternoon. She&#x2019;d played second lead that morning to her partner&#x2019;s primary role in the unfortunate demise of Vickie Trendor, the third wife of the unrepentant Alan Trendor, who&#x2019;d smashed her skull with an inferior bottle of California chardonnay.<br>According to the new widower, it wasn&#x2019;t accurate to say he&#x2019;d bashed her brains out when she simply hadn&#x2019;t had any brains to begin with.<br>While the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense hammered out a plea arrangement, Eve had made a dent in her paperwork, discussed strategy with two of her detectives on an ongoing case and congratulated another on closing one.<br>A pretty good day, in her estimation.<br>Now, she and Peabody, her partner, were speeding across the water in a boat she judged to be about the size of a surfboard toward the orange hulk of a ferry stalled halfway between Manhattan and Staten Island.<br>&#x201c;This is absolutely mag!&#x201d; Peabody stood near the bow, her square-jawed face lifted to the wind, her short, flippy hair flying.<br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jeez, Dallas!&#x201d; Peabody lowered her shades down her nose, exposing delighted brown eyes. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re getting a boat ride. We&#x2019;re on the water. Half the time you can forget Manhattan&#x2019;s an island.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I like about it. Out here, it makes you wonder, how come it doesn&#x2019;t sink? All that weight&#x2014;the buildings, the streets, the people. It should go down like a stone.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Come on.&#x201d; With a laugh, Peabody pushed her shades back in place. &#x201c;Statue of Liberty,&#x201d; she pointed out. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s the best.&#x201d;<br>Eve wouldn&#x2019;t argue. She&#x2019;d come close to dying inside the landmark, fighting radical terrorists bent on blowing it up. Even now, she could look at its lines, its grandeur, and see her husband, bleeding, clinging to a ledge outside the proud face.<br>They&#x2019;d survived that one, she mused, and Roarke had diffused the bomb, saved the day. Symbols mattered, and because they&#x2019;d fought and bled, people could chug by on the ferry every day and snap their pictures of freedom.<br>That was fine, that was the job. What she didn&#x2019;t get was why Homicide had to zip off the island because the Department of Transportation cops couldn&#x2019;t find a passenger.<br>Blood all over a bathroom and a missing woman. Interesting, sure, she decided, but not really her turf. In fact, it wasn&#x2019;t turf at all. It was water. It was a big orange boat on the water.<br>Why didn&#x2019;t boats sink? The errant thought reminded her that sometimes they did, and she decided not to dwell on it.<br>When the turbo approached that big orange boat, she noted people ranged along the rail on the tiers of decks. Some of them waved.<br>Beside her, Peabody waved back.<br>&#x201c;Cut it out,&#x201d; Eve ordered.<br>&#x201c;Sorry. It&#x2019;s knee-jerk. Looks like DOT sent out backup,&#x201d; she commented, nodding toward the turbos at the base of the ferry with the Department of Transportation logo emblazoned on the hull. &#x201c;I hope she didn&#x2019;t fall over. Or jump. But somebody would notice that, right?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;More likely she wandered off from the passenger areas, got lost and is currently trying to wander back.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Blood,&#x201d; Peabody reminded her, and Eve shrugged.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just wait and see.&#x201d;<br>That, too, was part of the job&#x2014;the waiting and seeing. She&#x2019;d been a cop for a dozen years and knew the dangers of jumping to conclusions.<br>She shifted her weight as the turbo slowed, bracing on long legs while she scanned the rails, the faces, the open areas. Her short hair fluttered around her face while those eyes&#x2014;golden brown, long and cop-flat&#x2014;studied what might or might not be a crime scene.<br>When the turbo was secured, she stepped off.<br>She judged the man who stepped forward to offer his hand as late twenties. He wore the casual summer khakis and light blue shirt with its DOT emblem well. Sun-streaked hair waved around a face tanned by sun or design. Pale green eyes contrasted with the deeper tone, and added an intensity.<br>&#x201c;Lieutenant, Detective, I&#x2019;m Inspector Warren. I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t located your passenger, Inspector?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. A search is still under way.&#x201d; He gestured for them to walk with him. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve added a dozen officers to the DOT crew aboard to complete the search, and to secure the area where the missing woman was last seen.&#x201d;<br>They started up a set of stairs.<br>&#x201c;How many passengers aboard?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The ticker counted three thousand, seven hundred and sixty-one boarding at Whitehall.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Inspector, it wouldn&#x2019;t be procedure to call Homicide on a missing passenger.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, but none of this is hitting SOP. I have to tell you, Lieutenant, it doesn&#x2019;t make sense.&#x201d; He took the next set of stairs, glancing over at the people hugging the rail. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind admitting, this situation is above my pay grade. And right now, most of the passengers are being patient. It&#x2019;s mostly tourists, and this is kind of an adventure. But if we hold the ferry here much longer, it&#x2019;s not going to be pretty.&#x201d;<br>Eve stepped onto the next deck where DOT officials had cordoned off a path. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you give me a rundown, Inspector?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The missing woman is Carolee Grogan, tourist from Missouri, on board with her husband and two sons. Age forty-three. I&#x2019;ve got her description and a photo taken aboard this afternoon. She and her youngest went to get drinks, hit the johns first. He went into the men&#x2019;s, and she was going into the women&#x2019;s. Told him to wait for her right outside if he got out first. He waited, and she didn&#x2019;t come out.&#x201d;<br>Warren paused outside the restroom area, nodded to another DOT official on the women&#x2019;s room door. &#x201c;Nobody else went in or out either. After a few minutes, he called her on his &#x2019;link. She didn&#x2019;t answer. He called his father, and the father and the other son came over. The father, Steven Grogan, asked a woman&#x2014;ah, Sara Hunning&#x2014;if she&#x2019;d go in and check on his wife.&#x201d;<br>Warren opened the door. &#x201c;And this is what she found inside.&#x201d;<br>Eve stepped in behind Warren. She smelled the blood immediately. A homicide cop gets a nose for it. It soured the citrusy/sterilized odor of the air in the black-and-white room with its steel sinks, and around the dividing wall, the white-doored stalls.<br>It washed over the floor, a spreading dark pool that snaked in trails across the white, slashed over the stall doors, the opposing wall, like abstract graffiti.<br>&#x201c;If that&#x2019;s Grogan&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Eve said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re not looking for a missing passenger. You&#x2019;re looking for a dead one.&#x201d;<br>Two<br>&#x201c;Record on, Peabody.&#x201d; Eve switched on her own. &#x201c;Dallas, Lieutenant Eve; Peabody, Detective Delia; Warren, DOT Inspector . . .&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jake,&#x201d; he supplied.<br>&#x201c;On scene aboard Staten Island Ferry.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Hillary Rodham Clinton,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;Second deck, port side, women&#x2019;s restroom.&#x201d;<br>She cocked a brow, nodded. &#x201c;Responding to report of missing passenger, Grogan, Carolee, last seen entering this area. Peabody, get a sample of the blood. We&#x2019;ll need to make sure it&#x2019;s human, then type it.&#x201d;<br>She opened the field kit she hadn&#x2019;t fully believed she&#x2019;d need for Seal It. &#x201c;How many people have been in and out of here since Grogan was missed?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Since I&#x2019;ve been on board, just me. Prior, to the best of my knowledge, Sara Hunning, Steven Grogan and two ferry officers on board.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s an Out of Order sign on the door.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But she came in anyway.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nobody we&#x2019;ve spoken to can absolutely confirm. She told the kid she was going in.&#x201d;<br>Sealed, Eve stepped into the first of the four stalls, waved a hand over the sensor. The toilet flushed efficiently. She repeated the gesture in the other three stalls, with the same results.<br>&#x201c;Appears to be in order.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s human,&#x201d; Peabody told her, holding up her gauge. &#x201c;Type A Negative.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Some smears, but no drag marks,&#x201d; Eve murmured. She gestured toward a narrow utility closet. &#x201c;Who opened that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I did,&#x201d; Jake told her. &#x201c;On the chance she&#x2014;or her body&#x2014;was in there. It was locked.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s only one way in and out.&#x201d; Peabody walked around to the sink area. &#x201c;No windows. If that&#x2019;s Carolee Grogan&#x2019;s blood, she didn&#x2019;t stand up and walk out of here.&#x201d;<br>Eve stood at the edge of the blood pool. &#x201c;How do you get a dead body out of a public restroom, on a ferry in the middle of the harbor, under the noses of more than three thousand people? And why the hell don&#x2019;t you leave it where it dropped in the first place?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not an answer to that,&#x201d; Jake began, &#x201c;but this is a tourist boat. It doesn&#x2019;t carry any vehicles, has extra concession areas. People tend to hug the rails and look out, or hang in a concession and snack as they watch out the windows. Still, it&#x2019;d take a lot of luck and enormous cojones to cart a bleeding body along the deck.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Balls maybe, but nobody&#x2019;s got that kind of luck. I&#x2019;ll need this room sealed, Inspector. And I want to talk to the missing woman&#x2019;s family, and the witness. Peabody, let&#x2019;s get the sweepers out here. I want every inch of this room covered.&#x201d;<br>Eve considered Jake&#x2019;s foresight in having the Grogan family sequestered in one of the canteen&#x2019;s solid. It kept them away from other passengers, gave them seats, and access to food and drink. That, she assumed, had kept the kids calm.<br>Calm enough, she noted, for the smaller of the two boys to curl on the narrow seat of the booth with his head in his father&#x2019;s lap.<br>The man con...</p></p><h2>Notes on the State of Virginia</h2><p>Available for the first time in Penguin Classics, Notes on the State of Virginia is at once a scientific discourse, an attempt to define America, and an examination of the idea of freedom. With the same genius and clear, flexible prose style that informs the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson chronicles Virginia's natural, social, and political history.<p>Frank Shuffleton includes in this edition with selections from relevant correspondence and discusses the work's origins, composition, and initial reception. He focuses particularly on Jefferson's response to contemporary scientific writings on "New World degeneracy"; his differing treatment of Blacks and Native Americans; and his influential (and problematic) role in creating a mythicized American self-image.</p></p><p>"[Peden] has made available the authoritative edition of one of the most important books to emerge in eighteenth-century America. He has set forth the history of its reception and criticism in such a way as to establish his point that in the 'Notes on Virginia' Jefferson 'produced one of America's first permanent literary and intellectual landmarks.'"-- <i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i> <br>This American classic is the only full-length book written and published by Thomas Jefferson during his lifetime. Written in 1781, Notes on the State of Virginia was begun by Jefferson as a commentary on the resources and institutions of his home state, but the work&#39;s lasting value lies in its delineation of Jefferson&#39;s major philosophical, political, scientific, and ethical beliefs. Along with his accounts of such factual matters as North American flora and fauna, Jefferson expounds his views on slavery, education, religious freedom, representative government, and the separation of church and state. The book is the best single statement of Jefferson&#39;s principles and the best reflection of his wide-ranging tastes and talents. This edition, meticulously edited by William Peden, was originally published by the University of North Carolina Press in 1955.</p><h2>Get Even 2: More Dirty Tricks from the Master of Revenge</h2><p>Enemies beware!

Not merely an account of Goethe's own life, this book also explores the influences on his early years--friends, mentors, famous personages of his time, intellectual movements, cities, and historical events--to draw a lifelike picture of his time.</p></p><p>Jon D.

A true page-turner, the heat is immediately turned to high, and never cools until the close of the very last chapter. Brian Jacques's skill lies in creating fantastical yet believable characters, placing them in an extraordinary yet convincing setting and then letting loose with a flood of imagination that takes the breath away. One of the best writers of our time, Jacques comes through once again for his readers in this remarkable tale of good triumphing over evil. <i>--Susan Harrison</i></p><b>Brian Jacques</b>&nbsp;was both a master storyteller and a jack-of-all-trades.

If only Rachel could be that happy.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, January 2015:</strong> Intersecting, overlapping, not-quite-what-they-seem lives. Jealousies and betrayals and wounded hearts. A haunting unease that clutches and won&#x2019;t let go. All this and more helps propel Paula Hawkins&#x2019;s addictive debut into a new stratum of the psychological thriller genre. At times, I couldn&#x2019;t help but think: <i>Hitchcockian</i>. From the opening line, the reader knows what they&#x2019;re in for: &#x201c;She&#x2019;s buried beneath a silver birch tree, down towards the old train tracks...&#x201d; But Hawkins teases out the mystery with a veteran&#x2019;s finesse. The &#x201c;girl on the train&#x201d; is Rachel, who commutes into London and back each day, rolling past the backyard of a happy-looking couple she names Jess and Jason. Then one day Rachel sees &#x201c;Jess&#x201d; kissing another man. The day after that, Jess goes missing. The story is told from three character&#x2019;s not-to-be-trusted perspectives: Rachel, who mourns the loss of her former life with the help of canned gin and tonics; Megan (aka Jess); and Anna, Rachel&#x2019;s ex-husband&#x2019;s wife, who happens to be Jess/Megan&#x2019;s neighbor. Rachel&#x2019;s voyeuristic yearning for the seemingly idyllic life of Jess and Jason lures her closer and closer to the investigation into Jess/Megan&#x2019;s disappearance, and closer to a deeper understanding of who she really is. And who she isn&#x2019;t. This is a book to be devoured. <i>-Neal Thompson</i></p>Paula Hawkinsworked as a journalist for fifteen years before turning her hand to fiction.

Matthieu Ricard has lived in the Himalayas for over thirty years."Terma," a Tibetan word meaning "revealed treasures," applies to teachings hidden by ancient masters under rocks or in the earth to be found by future generations; it also applies to this massive volume of photographs and text. The F�llmis have spent 25 years living, working and travelling in the Himalayas with peasants, nomads, monks and spiritual masters; Ricard, a monk himself, has photographed life in Tibet and Nepal for 30 years and is the French translator for the Dalai Lama. Their giant, glossy photographs (often in two-page spreads) capture the vividness of Tibet's landscape and people in beautiful detail. The accompanying essays cover basic Buddhist concepts, schools of Tibetan Buddhism, Tibetan astrology and medicine as well as profiles of village, monastic and nomadic life. (The topic of meditation, however-a core practice of Buddhism-strangely warrants only a brief description in the glossary.) Chilling accounts of the Chinese invasion and occupation and its results (1,200,000 slaughtered, over 6,000 temples destroyed) convey the bleakness of the situation: this is a culture on the verge of extinction. Captions to the 185 color photographs come at the end of the book, and although going back and forth from photo to explanatory text can be bothersome, the stunningly rich images make the effort worthwhile. For anyone interested in Buddhism and the history and culture of Tibet, this book is a worthy object of meditation. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Return To Castle Wolfenstein: Prima&#39;s Official Strategy Guide</h2><p><b>Pierce the heart of the Third Reich!</b><br><br>� Detailed single-player mission walkthroughs<br>� Special color insert covers basics and maps<br>� Comprehensive enemy info<br>� Detailed stats for every weapon and item<br>� Secret Areas and Treasure Items revealed<br>� Multiplayer tactics covering objectives, character classes, and special abilities for both Axis and Allies</p><p></p><h2>Escoffier: The Complete Guide to the Art of Modern Cookery</h2><p>Presented for the first time to the English-speaking public, here is the entire translation of Auguste Escoffier's masterpiece <i>Le Guide Culinaire</i>.

Its basic principles are as valid today as when it was first published in 1903. It has successfully withstood the test of decades and remains a nonpareil among cookery books. Escoffier was personally involved with each new French edition of his work right up until 1921, when the fourth edition appeared. He altered and improved it over the years in line with his ideas of modification and adaptation. It is the fourth edition which has now been translated into English for the first time by H. L. Cracknell and R. J. Kaufmann. This translation supersedes A Guide to Modern Cookery, the English version first published in 1907; it contained a fair percentage of Escoffier&#x2019;s recipes but was not, unlike The Complete Guide to the Art of Modern Cookery, the comprehensive collection which contains some 2000 additional recipes. Great care has been taken to use the original metric measurements and to give accurate conversions to Imperial and American measurements in brackets. Le Guide Culinaire is described by Escoffier himself as &#x2018;a useful tool rather than just a recipe book&#x2019;. It does not go into minute details of preparation, but offers to those who practise the art of cookery &#x2014; whether they be professional chefs or managers, housewives, gourmets or students of haute cuisine &#x2014; invaluable guidelines culled from more than fifty years&#x2019; experience. The Complete Guide to the Art of Modern Cookery is therefore a repository of all that is best in Classical French and International cookery and should be kept close at hand and referred to constantly. A Memoir of Escoffier by his grandson, Pierre P. Escoffier, appears at the beginning of the book. An exhaustive index is also provided.H. L. CRACKNELL and R. J. KAUFMANN spent their early years working in the kitchens of several large hotels in London and Europe. The translators met when they were both working at London&#x2019;s Savoy Hotel in the late 1940s: a kitchen where the shadow of its first chef, Escoffier, still cast its influence. They subsequently became lecturers in cookery in a number of technical colleges where they endeavoured to maintain the importance of those fundamentals which Escoffier saw as necessary to the profitability and success of any catering enterprise. The translators have been on the staff of leading centres of catering education in the United Kingdom. H. L. Cracknell is a member of the Association Culinaire Fran�aise, founded by A. Escoffier and E. F�tu in 1903. and they are also holders of the Ma�trise Escoffier and Cordon Culinaire, both awarded by the Conseil Culinaire Fran�ais. The translators have acted as consultant editors to The Illustrated Escoffier, also published by Heinemann, as a selection of several hundred of the more popular recipes from this book, many of which are illustrated with superb colour photographs and contain more detailed information for their preparation.</p><h2>Fisher-Price Little People: The Story of Christmas (Boardbooks - Board Book)</h2><p>Based on the best-selling Fisher-Price nativity set, this book tells the story of the first Christmas in friendly Little People style.

The Human Resource Development Research Handbook argues that expert HRD professionals think like researchers. You don&#39;t need to be a researcher to obtain consistently high-quality HRD results, but thinking like a researcher gives you the discipline required to be an expert. Thus, the much-hyped gap between theory and practice is the arena of opportunity and excellence. The Human Resource Development Research Handbook gives practitioners the tools they need to stay on the leading edge of the profession. It addresses three core areas: The practical importance of research; ways of doing practical research; and getting started on research. Written for practitioners and scholars, this is the first book to explain the value, purposes, methods, and processes of HRD research in clear, simple language. The Human Resource Development Research Handbook demystifies the research process so HRD practitioners can transform their practice to incorporate leading-edge research.

I nearly didn't notice when his thoughts touched mine. It was a rare thing these days; rarer still that I would let him in, but my own thoughts were drifting and I knew that his were, too. In fact, from what I saw of where he was-the angle of the ceiling and the dimly shadowed walls-I guessed that he was likely still in bed, just waking up himself.</p> <p>I didn't need to push him out. Already he was drawing back, apologizing. Sorry. Not a spoken word, but still I heard the faint regretful tone of his familiar voice. And then he wasn't there.</p> <p>A man sat heavily beside me, squeezed me over on the seat, and with my senses feeling raw already, even that unwanted contact was too much. I stood, and braced myself against the bit of wall beside the nearest door and forced myself to balance till we came to Bond Street. When the doors slid open, I slid safely back into the comfort of routine, my brisk steps keeping pace with everybody else as we became a texting, talking, moving mass that flowed together up and out and through the turnstiles and emerged onto the pavement where we went our separate ways, heads down and purposeful.</p> <p>The morning was a lovely one for August. The oppressive sticky heat had given way to fresher air that promised warmth but didn't threaten, and the sky was a pristine and perfect blue.</p> <p>I barely saw it. I was thinking of that shadowed room, a grayer light that spoke of clouds or maybe rain, a hand that had come lazily in view, to rub his eyes while he was waking. It had been his left hand, and there'd been no rings on it. At least, I didn't think I'd seen a ring on it.</p> <p>I caught my thoughts before they had a chance to wander further and betray me. Doesn't matter, I reminded myself firmly, and to make quite sure I heard myself I said the words aloud: "It doesn't matter."</p> <p>I could feel the glances of the people walking closest to me, wondering if I were off my trolley, and I flushed a little, tucking my head well down as I came round the corner and into South Molton Street, a little pedestrian haven of upscale shops, caf�s, and galleries. Everything always seemed quieter here, with the mad rush of Bond Street behind me. I carried on down past the graceful old buildings with beautiful doors to the one with the freshly white-painted fa�ade where an expensive-looking brass plaque with fine lettering read: Galerie St.-Croix, Fine Russian Artefacts and Art, Third Floor.</p> <p>The naming of the gallery had been one of Sebastian's little vanities-in spite of his French surname, he was English through and through, born of a line that likely traced its Hampshire roots back to the Conquest. But Sebastian knew his business, and to art dealers like him, it was essential to create the proper image.</p> <p>I was part of that, I knew, because I had the proper look, the proper pedigree, the right credentials, and I always dressed to fit the part. But when he'd hired me two years ago, he'd also made no secret of the fact that it had been for my abilities-not only that I held a master's degree in Russian Studies and the History of Art, but also that I spoke fluent Russian besides, and my organized nature appealed to his strong sense of order, and I had, what he'd called then, "potential."</p> <p>He'd worked to transform me, to mentor me, teaching me how to get on the right side of the bid at an auction, and how to finesse our more difficult clients. I'd come a long way from the rather unworldly young woman I'd been when he'd taken me on.</p> <p>He had transformed the gallery building as well. We were on the third floor, in a space that today was as richly detailed as a penthouse. Even the lift was mirrored, which this morning didn't thrill me.</p> <p>I was frowning as it opened to the elegant reception room where a flower-seller painted by Natalia Goncharova hung above the desk at which our previous receptionist had sat. She'd had to leave us unexpectedly, and I'd been interviewing this past week to fill the vacancy, while Sebastian and I shared out the extra duties.</p> <p>It was not an easy thing to hire a person who could suit Sebastian's tastes, aesthetically. He wanted something more than simple competence, or class. He wanted someone who embodied what the Goncharova painting did-the painting he had hung above that desk, where it would be the first thing noticed by each customer who stepped into the gallery.</p> <p>He'd had offers for it. Several of our clients could afford to pay a million pounds with ease, but then Sebastian didn't need the money.</p> <p>"If I sell the thing," he'd told me once, "then I'll have only satisfied one client. If I leave it where it is, then every one of them will think it can be theirs one day."</p> <p>It didn't only work with art. It wasn't a coincidence that many of our loyal and best customers were women, and they looked upon Sebastian as they did that Goncharova flower-seller, as a prize that could be won, with time and effort.</p> <p>In fact, as I passed by his glass-walled office on the way down to my own, I saw he had a woman with him now. I would have left them to their business, but he saw me and beckoned me in, so I pushed the door open and joined them.</p> <p>Sebastian's smile was all professional, with me, and even if it hadn't been, I would have been immune to it. He was too rich to be my type. A gold watch flashed beneath his tailored sleeve as he leaned forward, looking so immaculate, I half-suspected that he had a team of stylists working on him every morning, from his polished shoes right to the tousled toffee-colored hair that had been combed with just the right amount of carelessness.</p> <p>"Nicola," he introduced me, "this is Margaret Ross. Miss Ross, my associate, Nicola Marter."</p> <p>Miss Margaret Ross was not what I'd expected, not our usual sort of client. For one thing, she was plainly dressed but dressed with so much care I knew she'd taken pains to look her best. And although I was usually quite good at guessing ages, I had trouble guessing hers. She had to be a decade older than myself, so nearing forty at the least, but while her clothing and the way she held herself suggested she might be still older, there was something in her quiet gaze that seemed distinctly youthful, even innocent.</p> <p>"Good morning." She was Scottish. "I'm afraid that I've been wasting Mr. St.-Croix's time."</p> <p>Sebastian, ever charming, shook his head. "No, not at all. That's what I'm here for. And even if it can't be proved, you still have a fascinating story to tell your grandchildren."</p> <p>She cast her eyes down as though she were hiding disappointment. "Yes."</p> <p>"Tell Nicola." Sebastian's tone was meant to salve her feelings, make her feel that what she had to say was fascinating, even if it wasn't. He was good that way. To me, he said, "She brought this carving in for an appraisal."</p> <p>It looked to me, at first, an undistinguished lump of wood that curved to fit his upraised palm, but when I looked again, I saw it was a small carved bird, wings folded tightly to its sides, a sparrow or a wren. Sebastian was saying, "It's been in her family... how long?"</p> <p>Margaret Ross roused herself to his smooth prompting. "Nearly three hundred years, so I'm told. It was given to one of my ancestors by Empress Catherine of Russia. Not Catherine the Great," she said, showing her knowledge. "The first Catherine."</p> <p>Sebastian smiled encouragement. "Peter the Great's widow, yes. So, the 1720s sometime. And it very well might be that old." Holding the carving as though it were priceless, he studied it.</p> <p>Margaret Ross told him, "We call it the Firebird. That's what it's always been called, in our family. It sat under glass in my grandmother's house, and we children were never allowed to come near it. My mother said"-there was the tiniest break in her voice, but she covered it over-"she said, with Andrew gone-Andrew's my brother, he died in Afghanistan-with him gone, and me not likely to have any family myself now, my mother said there was no point in the Firebird sitting there, going to waste. She said I should sell it, and use all the money to travel, like I'd always wanted to do."</p> <p>"Miss Ross," said Sebastian, to me, "lost her mother quite recently."</p> <p>I understood his manner now, his sympathy. I told her, "I'm so sorry."</p> <p>"That's all right. She had MS; it wasn't the easiest life for her. And she felt guilty for having me there to look after her. But," she said, trying to smile, "I looked after my aunties as well, till they passed, and she was my own mother. I couldn't have left her alone, could I?"</p> <p>Looking again at her eyes, I decided their youthfulness came from the fact that she'd never been able to live her own life as a woman. She'd put her own life in limbo while caring for others. I felt for her. And I felt, too, for the mother who'd hoped that her daughter would sell their one prized family heirloom, and finally have money and comfort to live just a little. To travel.</p> <p>"The thing is," Sebastian said, kindly, "without any documentation or proof, what we dealers call provenance, we simply can't know for certain. And without that provenance, I'm afraid this poor creature has little real value. We can't even tell if it's Russian." He looked at me. "Nicola? What would you say?"</p> <p>He passed it to me and I took it, not thinking, forgetting my mind had already been breached once this morning. It wasn't until I was holding it, light in my hands, that I realized I'd made a mistake.</p> <p>Instantly I felt a warmth that had nothing to do with the carving itself. I closed my eyes to try to stop the vision, but that only made it worse. I saw a slanting fall of light, with fine dust dancing through it. Two women, one aging but lovely, with heavy black eyebrows; the other respectfully bent, perhaps kneeling, her young face upturned in uncertainty. "My darling Anna," the first woman said to the other in elegant Russian, and smiled. "You were never a nobody."</p> <p>I opened my eyes quickly, maybe a little too quickly, but to my relief no one seemed to have noticed. "I really don't know," I said, giving the small carved bird back to Sebastian.</p> <p>He looked at it with a commendable blend of admiration and regret.</p> <p>"The trouble is," he told our would-be client, "it's so difficult to date this sort of thing with any certainty. If it is Russian, it was very likely peasant-made; there is no maker's mark or factory stamp to go by, and without any documentation..." He raised one shoulder slightly in a shrug that seemed to speak to the unfairness of it all. "If she had brought you back an icon, now, this ancestor of yours, or some small piece of jewelry-that I might have helped you with."</p> <p>"I understand," said Margaret Ross. Her tone was bleak.</p> <p>Sebastian turned the little carving over in his hands one final time, and I knew he was searching for some small thing to praise, to let this woman down as gently as he could. "Certainly it's very old," was what he ended up with, "and I'm sure it's had a few adventures."</p> <p>Margaret Ross wasn't sure about that. "It's been sitting there under that glass for as long as I've known it, and likely it sat there a good while before that."</p> <p>The twist of her faint smile held sympathy, as though she knew how that felt, to be there on the mantelpiece watching the bright world pass by, and I saw the small sag of defeat in her shoulders as, accepting Sebastian's return of the carved bird, she started to carefully wrap it back up in its layers of yellowed, creased tissue.</p> <p>Impulse drove me to ask aloud, "What was her name?"</p> <p>She looked up. "Sorry?"</p> <p>"Your ancestor. The one who brought your Firebird back from Russia."</p> <p>"Anna. That's all we know of her, really, we don't know her surname. It was her daughter married into the Ross family, that's how the Firebird came down to us."</p> <p>Anna. Something tingled warmly up my arm. My darling Anna...</p> <p>"Because maybe," I suggested, "you could try a bit of research, to establish some connection between her and Empress Catherine."</p> <p>From Sebastian's glance I couldn't tell if he was grateful or annoyed, but he chimed in with, "Yes, if you were able to find proof of any kind, that would be useful."</p> <p>Again that faint twist of a smile that spoke volumes about how much hope she held now of discovering that. She admitted, "My granny tried once, so she said, but no joy. Common people, they don't make the history books. And on our side of the family, there's nobody famous."</p> <p>I saw the warm smile in my mind. Heard the voice. You were never a nobody.</p> <p>"Well," said Sebastian, beginning to stand, "I am sorry we couldn't be more of a help to you. But if you'll leave us your address, we'll keep it in mind, and if ever a client requests something like it..."</p> <p>I felt like a traitor, as Margaret Ross stood, too, and shook both our hands. The feeling held as we escorted her back out into reception, and Sebastian, with full chivalry and charm, gave her his card and wished her well and said good-bye. And as the lift doors closed he turned to me and, reading the expression in my eyes, said, "Yes, I know."</p> <p>Except he didn't.</p> <p>There was no way that he could have known. In all the time I'd worked for him I'd never told him anything about what I could do, and even if I'd told him, he'd have rubbished the idea. "Woo-woo stuff," he would have called it, as he'd done the day our previous receptionist had told us she was visiting a psychic.</p> <p>"No," she'd said, "she really sees things. It's this gift she has-she holds a thing you've owned, see, like a necklace, or a ring, and she can tell you things about yourself. It's called psychometry." She'd said the term with confident authority.</p> <p>Sebastian, with a sidelong look, had said, "It's called a scam. There is no way that anyone can be a psychic. It's not possible."</p> <p>I'd offered him no argument, although I could have told him he was wrong. I could have told him I was psychic, and had been for as long as I remembered. Could have told him that I, too, saw detailed visions, if I concentrated on an object someone else had held. And sometimes, like today, I saw the visions even when I didn't try, or concentrate, although that happened very, very rarely now.</p> <p>The flashes of unwanted visions had been more a feature of my childhood, and I had to close my eyes and truly focus now to use my "gift"-my curse, I would have called it. I had chosen not to use it now for years.</p> <p>Two years, to be exact.</p> <p>I'd chosen to be normal, and I meant to go on being normal, having the respect of those I worked with, not their nudges or their stares. So there was no good reason why, when I sat down at the computer in my office, I ignored the string of waiting emails and began an image search instead.</p> <p>I found three portraits, different in their poses and the sitter's age, but in all three I recognized the woman easily because of her black hair, her heavy arching eyebrows, and her warm dark eyes. The same eyes that had smiled this morning in the brief flash of a vision I had viewed when I had held the wooden Firebird.</p> <p>There could be no mistaking her: the first Empress Catherine, the widow of Peter the Great.</p> <p>"Damn," I whispered. And meant it.</p></p><h2>LONG SHOT (The 3 investigators)</h2><p>The seventeen-year-old Three Investigators become involved in tracking down a basketball scandal when Pete receives a corrupt offer from a local college.</p><p></p><h2>The Rabbit Hunter: A novel (Killer Instinct)</h2><p><i>Ten little rabbits, all dressed in white</i><br> <i>Tried to get to heaven on the end of a kite.</i><br> <i>Kite string got broken, down they all fell,</i><br> <i>Instead of going to heaven, they all went to...<br></i><b><br> It begins with a nursery rhyme.

One of the best-selling children&#39;s books of all time. First released in book form in 1946, this story has since appeared in numerous editions. It tells of a small angel who simply can&#39;t get with the program no matter how hard he tries. Then an understanding elder angel realizes that he&#39;s homesick and is able to retrieve a box of his most treasured possessions from &#34;back home.&#34; When it comes time for Jesus to be born on Earth, The Littlest Angel gives his precious box to the Baby, but he is worried that God will think his gift too humble. However, God is pleased indeed, and transforms the box into The Star of Bethlehem. The Littlest Angel is presented with the award-winning artistry of Paul Micich who has won several awards and medals for his work. Young Ari Micich was the model for his father&#39;s artwork in The Littlest Angel.</p><p>Charles Tazewell has authored several children's stories, including <i>The Littleset Snowman's Christmas Gift</i> which won the Thomas A. Edison Prize in 1956Grade 1-3?First released in book form in 1946, this story has since appeared in numerous editions. It tells of a small angel who simply can't get with the program no matter how hard he tries until an understanding elder realizes that he is homesick and is able to retrieve a box of his most treasured possessions from "back home." When it comes time for Jesus to be born on Earth, the Littlest Angel gives his precious box to the Baby, but he is worried that God will think his gift too humble. However, God is pleased indeed, and transforms the box into the Star of Bethlehem. The writing style is rather ornate and full of grandiose words and phrases, but some children will love to hear it read aloud. The oil paintings are muted and full of texture, and not at all sentimental. The celestial choir is multicultural, and the Littlest Angel has red shorts peeking out of his robe. Paul Micich's version (Ideals, 1991) has a glossier "greeting-card" look. This reincarnation of the story will be as popular as its predecessors.?EM<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Catching Fire (Hunger Games Trilogy)</h2><p>Catching Fire</p><p>Suzanne Collins&#39; debut novel, Gregor the Overlander, the first book in The Underland Chronicles, received wide praise both in the United States and abroad. The series has been a New York Times bestseller and received numerous accolades. Also a writer for children&#39;s television, Suzanne lives with her family in Connecticut.This story and audio fulfill the promise of the stunning debut in this series, THE HUNGER GAMES, in which a cruel contest required 24 young people to fight in mortal combat. Carolyn McCormick delivers the first-person narrative of Katniss, the heroine whose brilliant strategy in that book thwarted tradition and turned her and her partner, Peeta, into victors. McCormick&#39;s phrasing is clipped, almost staccato, a style that embodies Katniss&#39;s secretive, wary attitudes. The tension builds as the oppression of the controlling President Snow inflames rebellion in Katniss and her fellow citizens. At the climax McCormick narrates at a breakneck pace as Katniss and Peeta compete against all previous winners of the combat tournament. Listeners will be eager for the next installment. S.W.

You have shared your lives with me over the years and I&#x2019;m eternally grateful for everything I&#x2019;ve learned from you; for your dedication to health; for how hard you work to find happiness; for your willingness to learn lessons I know are tough; for your trust.</p><p>To my mother. I know how much you&#x2019;ve accomplished, and I know how hard you&#x2019;ve struggled. I wish I could have helped you when you needed it most, but I was too young. Thank you for inspiring me to believe I could help others. Thank you for inspiring in me the desire to learn the truth about love.</p><p>And to my daughters. You&#x2019;re the best, and you deserve a world of love.</p><p><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></p><p>This is a book about truth and love. It would not have been possible without the work of Dr. Charles Foster. Every word here is the product of a fifty/fifty collaboration between us. His research, insights, and ideas fill this book. We are full partners in everything. Because of him, in every way this search for the truth has been a labor of love.</p><p>I&#x2019;m profoundly grateful to all the individuals whose lives and stories went into the research for <i>Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay.</i> They were amazingly open and helpful, and what we&#x2019;ve learned from them constitutes the bricks out of which this book is built.</p><p>There are many people I must mention if I&#x2019;m to thank them properly. The debt I owe each of them makes me wish I could do more, in this small space, than list their names. These people are, one way or another, colleagues, teachers, heroes, friends who&#x2019;ve given something specific to me, personally or professionally, through the years here at Chestnut Hill and elsewhere. They may not even realize the value of what they&#x2019;ve done for me, but it played some role in making these pages possible. To all of them I say thank you: Louise Bates Ames, Shaye Areheart, Lisa Bankoff, Susan Bickelhaupt, Ruth Bork, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Alexia Dorszynski, Barry Dym, Dorothy Firman, Roger Fisher, Betty Friedan, Diana Huss Green, Jennifer Hack, Jay Haley, Jules Henry, Kathleen Huntington, Allan Kaprow, Alfred Kazin, Michael Kirshenbaum, Mary Jo Kochakian, Rabbi Harold Kushner, Eda LeShan, Richard Marek, Amy Mintzer, Salvador Minuchin, Nancy Moscatillo, Eli Newberger, Maury Povich, Cynthia Roe, Izzy Rudski, Ann Ruethling, Kim Schaffer, Gitta Sereny, Myron Sharaf, Judith Sills, Ivy Fischer Stone, Richard Stuart, Walter Watson, Paul Watzlawick, Rosa Wexler, Robert White, Elie Wiesel, Beth Winship, and Harold Zyskind.</p><p>Some people are sadly no longer alive to hear my gratitude for what they&#x2019;ve given me. But I feel I must nonetheless express my thanks to Fred Avery, Gregory Bateson, Herbert Berghof, Martin Buber, Paul Goodman, Walter Green, Don Jackson, Pearl Karch, Virginia Satir, and Isaac Bashevis Singer.</p><p>I want to thank my daughters, Rachel and Hannah, who cared so much about this project and who expressed their love and intelligence by letting me feel the full weight of every constructive criticism they could think of.</p><p>What incredible good luck to have a mensch like Howard Morhaim as my agent. Without his gifts and his belief in me and in this project, all the people who need it would be denied the help this book offers. I am profoundly grateful to him. And a thanks to his assistant, Kate Hengerer.</p><p>My editor, Deborah Brody, has wowed me with her intelligence and enthusiasm. I thank her for caring about this book and for her marvelous ability to translate her caring into effective action that&#x2019;s enabling this information to reach as many people as possible.</p><p>I&#x2019;d also like to thank all the other terrific people at Penguin and Dutton who I know have helped and will help this book and me. I can&#x2019;t mention everyone&#x2019;s name but I would like to single out Marvin Brown, Judy Courtade, Arnold Dolin, Elaine Koster, and Peter Mayer. A thanks to Julianne Barbato for her excellent copy editing, and a thanks for the care she&#x2019;s taken with my work to Jennifer Moore. Finally, I know how important Lisa Johnson&#x2019;s inspired work on my behalf has been in the past and will be in the future, and I&#x2019;m grateful for it. And a special thanks to Tracy Guest.</p><p>I&#x2019;d like to thank all the readers of my previous book for their incredible support. It means so much to me. I&#x2019;d like to particularly thank the countless numbers of people who called and wrote just to tell me how much that book helped them.</p><p>Last, but not least, I must thank those patients of mine who kept asking me to write this book. I can&#x2019;t mention your names, but you know who you are.</p><p><b>TO MY READER</b></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>You are not alone. There are 140 million Americans today in a relationship, and one-fifth of them&#x2014;that&#x2019;s 28 million people&#x2014;just can&#x2019;t decide whether to stay or leave.</p><p>You deserve the happiness you&#x2019;re searching for. I&#x2019;ve dedicated years to developing a simple but comprehensive series of questions and guidelines that will help you see clearly, once and for all, whether it&#x2019;s best <i>for you</i> to stay in your relationship or leave it. The women and men you&#x2019;ll meet here have struggled with the same issues you have. Their experiences will help you discover what&#x2019;s real in your own relationship, regardless of how long you&#x2019;ve been with your partner or how long you&#x2019;ve been stuck in ambivalence.</p><p>This book contains only good news. If it&#x2019;s best for you to stay, you&#x2019;ll have the satisfying experience of facing all the issues and discovering that your relationship is truly too good to leave. You won&#x2019;t be settling; you&#x2019;ll know your heart is home.</p><p>And if you&#x2019;ll be happiest leaving, you&#x2019;ll get the reassurance that comes from finally understanding why your relationship has been too bad to stay in. When you end a relationship that deserves to end, you&#x2019;re liberating two people to move on to better lives.</p><p>Either way, because you&#x2019;ll see what&#x2019;s best for you, you&#x2019;ll be far happier than you&#x2019;ve been. Everything in your life will be better. I&#x2019;ve written this book to help you make this happen.</p><p><b>Part I</b></p><p><b>THE PROBLEM</b></p><p><b>1</b></p><p><b>Is You Is or Is You</b> <b>Ain&#x2019;t My Baby?</b></p><p>You&#x2019;ve gone through a lot to get to this point.</p><p>You&#x2019;ve hoped that love would be enough. And you&#x2019;ve worked to resolve the problems in your relationship. And you&#x2019;ve tried to accept things the way they are.</p><p>And you&#x2019;ve agonized over the possibility of leaving.</p><p>But you just haven&#x2019;t known what to do. Now you&#x2019;re ready to face the choice that&#x2019;s been weighing on your heart. That&#x2019;s what this book is for&#x2014;to help you discover which is best for you:</p><p></p><p><i>To stay in your relationship,</i> recommitting to it free of doubt, free of holding back, free at last to pour your love and energy into the relationship and get back everything there is to get from it</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>or</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><i>To leave your relationship,</i> finally liberating yourself from it, free of confusion, free of pain, free at last to get on with a new and better life.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Up until now you haven&#x2019;t found the kind of evidence that speaks to your heart and makes clear what&#x2019;s best for you. You haven&#x2019;t found a sign like one of the following:</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Leaving.</b> He wouldn&#x2019;t make her a sandwich. Heather had been working in the garden in the hot sun all morning, and Bill had been doing God knows what inside the house. Through the open kitchen window she&#x2019;d heard him grab a beer, and she asked if he&#x2019;d throw together a sandwich for her. &#x201c;No, you do it,&#x201d; he said, as if she&#x2019;d asked him to do something too hard, too inappropriate.</p><p>That&#x2019;s when it hit her, clear as day, once and for all, that his selfishness was undeniable and bottomless, that for her the relationship was over, that there was nothing here for her, and that she&#x2019;d be better off getting out. And she did. And she&#x2019;s never regretted it for a moment.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><i><b>Staying.</b></i> What had happened to the sweet woman he&#x2019;d married? Now, three years later, Steve felt that Lynn had turned into someone who did nothing but complain. Then one Friday coming home from work Steve heard a song on the radio&#x2014;&#x201c;When a Man Loves a Woman.&#x201d; Something about it got through to him, something about his having a responsibility to make sure she knew he loved her. They&#x2019;d gotten so polarized, he saw, that he&#x2019;d overlooked the possibility that she was unloving because he was unloving.</p><p>Steve spent that night and all weekend trying to show Lynn he loved her. It wasn&#x2019;t until Sunday that it got through to her. Then she just melted. Her old sweetness came back. It was suddenly clear to Steve how easily they could overcome the problems that had been making him think of leaving. Steve decided to put all thoughts of leaving out of his mind.</p><p><b>Good News</b> </p><p>It&#x2019;s terribly frustrating to be able to do nothing but wait passively for signs like these. Fortunately, new hope is now entirely realistic for you. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve written this book. You can find answers to the questions most important to you:</p><p></p><p>� Whether the two of you really do fit together or not</p><p>� Whether the things that bother you will get better or worse</p><p>� How you&#x2019;ll feel if they do get better and if they don&#x2019;t</p><p>� Whether you can improve the relationship on your own or with the best of therapists</p><p>� What you&#x2019;ll find if you leave and whether it&#x2019;ll be better or worse than what you have now</p><p>� How to balance the responsibility you have to yourself and to the people you care about</p><p></p><p></p><p>No matter how hard it&#x2019;s been for you to decide, now you <i>can</i> find out the truth about your relationship one way or the other, the whole truth, your own truth, the ultimate-reality-at-the-heart-of everything truth. Now you <i>can</i> achieve the clarity that will enable you to feel confident making one of the most important choices of your life.</p><p>But finding clarity depends on whether you actually <i>want</i> to find clarity in the first place or whether the most comfortable place for you is staying up in the air the way you&#x2019;ve been. Your relationship is <i>either</i> too good to leave or too bad to stay in. But it can&#x2019;t be both. So there are definite answers for you here, but if you really don&#x2019;t want to come to a decision, you&#x2019;ll find that out as well.</p><p><b>But What About Love?</b> </p><p>We&#x2019;ll talk <i>a lot</i> about love here.

(historical fiction). Simultaneous.</p><p>In the early 1830s, Sarah Grimk� and her younger sister, Angelina, were the most infamous women in America. They had rebelled so vocally against their family, society, and their religion that they were reviled, pursued, and exiled from their home city of Charleston, South Carolina, under threat of death. Their crime was speaking out in favor of liberty and equality and for African American slaves and women, arguments too radically humanist even for the abolitionists of their time. Their lectures drew crowds of thousands, even (shockingly, then) men, and their most popular pamphlet directly inspired Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x2019;s <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>--published 15 years later. These women took many of the first brutal backlashes against feminists and abolitionists, but even their names are barely known now. Sue Monk Kidd became fascinated by these sisters, and the question of what compelled them to risk certain fury and say with the full force of their convictions what others had not (or could not). She discovered that in 1803, when Sarah turned 11, her parents gave her the &#x201c;human present&#x201d; of 10-year-old Hetty to be her handmaid, and Sarah taught Hetty to read, an act of rebellion met with punishment so severe that the slave girl died of "an unspecified disease" shortly after her beating. Kidd knew then that she had to try to bring Hetty back to life (&#x201c;I would imagine what might have been," she tells us), and she starts these girls' stories here, both cast in roles they despise. She trades chapters between their voices across decades, imagining the Grimk� sisters&#x2019; courageous metamorphosis and, perhaps more vitally, she gives Hetty her own life of struggle and transformation. Few characters have ever been so alive to me as Hetty and Sarah. Long after you finish this book, you'll feel its courageous heart beating inside your own. -- <em>Mari Malcolm</em>Sue Monk Kidd is the award-winning and bestselling author of the novels&nbsp;<i>The Secret Life of Bees&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Mermaid Chair</i>.

She lives in Florida.</p><h2>Stephen Shore: Uncommon Places: The Complete Works</h2><p>Published by Aperture in 1982 and long unavailable, Stephen Shore's legendary <i>Uncommon Places</i> has influenced a generation of photographers. Among the first artists to take color beyond advertising and fashion photography, Shore's large-format color work on the American vernacular landscape stands at the root of what has become a vital photographic tradition. <i>Uncommon Places: The Complete Works</i> presents a definitive collection of the original series, much of it never before published or exhibited. Like Robert Frank and Walker Evans before him, Shore discovered a hitherto unarticulated version of America via highway and camera. Approaching his subjects with cool objectivity, Shore's images retain precise internal systems of gestures in composition and light through which the objects before his lens assume both an archetypal aura and an ambiguously personal importance. In contrast to Shore's signature landscapes with which <i>Un-common Places</i> is often associated, this expanded survey reveals equally remarkable collections of interiors and portraits. As a new generation of artists expands on the projects of the New Topographic and New Color photographers of the seventies--Thomas Struth (whose first book was titled <i>Unconscious Places</i>), Andreas Gursky and Catherine Opie among them--<i>Uncommon Places: The Complete Works</i> provides a timely opportunity to reexamine the diverse implications of Shore's project and offers a fundamental primer for the last 30 years of large-format color photography.</p><p>At the age of 24, <b>Stephen Shore</b> became the first living photographer to have a one-man show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Among his numerous other one-man shows, Shore has exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Kunsthalle D�sseldorf. He has received several awards for his photography including two National Endowment for the Arts Grants and a Guggenheim Foundation Grant. He has been the Chair of the photography department at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. since 1982.<br><br><br>Stephan Schmidt-Wulffen is a visiting scholar at the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.A teenaged photographic aspirant who hung around at Andy Warhol&#x2019;s factory in its mid-60s heyday, Shore found success early: his first show at New York&#x2019;s Metropolitan Museum of Art was held when he was only 23. These 152 full-page, full-color shots comprise his serial project of the 70s, "Uncommon Places," which documented roadside America with a dispassionate, Andy-like emptiness. It&#x2019;s an aesthetic that has been endlessly co-opted by American filmmakers like Gus Van Sant and Jim Jarmusch, but some of these 12 7/8" � 10 5/16" shots of prairies, parking lots, polyester-clad couples and plastic hotel furnishings manage to seem fresh nonetheless. Shore&#x2019;s concluding interview with Lynn Tillman makes the Warhol connection explicit, and argues for a kind of meaning-making from the void: "Formalism often sounds like a kind of visual nicety, but if I use it, that&#x2019;s not how I mean it." Beautiful, lush reproductions with minimal captions allow the photos to speak for themselves.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The theft only takes two minutes, but the brutal invasion robs Brooke of more than jewels: a shard of glass from the shattered window kills her 20-year-old niece, Kaitlin Crockett. When Brooke asks Theodosia to help find Kaitlin's killers, Theodosia comes up with a bold plan to lure the thieves with a fabulous brooch. A charming cast of characters, a cultivated and genteel setting, plenty of tea and scones, a plausible slate of suspects, and an exciting climatic chase in designer clothes and jewels all add up to another enjoyable outing with Theodosia and friends.

Blake's Togo (Philomel, 2002) comes another version of the story of the relay race across Alaska to save the people of Nome from an outbreak of diphtheria in 1925. While Blake focuses on one particular dog, Miller tells the more complete tale, beginning with the first dying children and including all of the details of carrying the serum from Anchorage, 1000 miles from its destination. The conditions were terrible as dog teams and mushers dealt with all sorts of problems caused by temperatures as low as 64 degrees below zero. Much of the story focuses on Leonhard Seppala, the musher who owned Togo, Balto, and many other sled dogs. Included are a list of the mushers who participated in the relay, additional information on the dogs that ran, brief information on the Iditarod, a trail map, and photographs of Seppala and Togo. Van Zyle, official artist of the Iditarod and a musher himself, has created vivid, full-spread paintings to bring the story to life. This book does not have the intensity of storytelling or art that is found in Togo, but for children whose interest is piqued by Blake's book, or for older readers, this is an excellent account told with lots of detail and drama.<br><i>Susan Oliver, Tampa-Hillsborough Public Library System, FL</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fire Burn: Tales of Witchery, a collection of true accounts of witchcraft and demonology</h2><p>Gathers stories of witchcraft and witch trials from all over the world, based on written and oral history</p><p></p><h2>Mr. Peabody&#39;s Apples</h2><p>This is the second picture book from Madonna with beautiful artwork by American artist Loren Long. Tommy Tittlebottom sees Mr Peabody taking an apple from Mr Funkadeli&#39;s fruit market and is very surprised that he doesn&#39;t pay. Then Tommy sees it happen again and decides that Mr Peabody is a thief. Word spreads quickly around the town. When Mr Peabody arrives at the baseball ground, ready for the usual Saturday game, only Billy Little turns up and he soon explains what has happened. It is then up to Mr Peabody to teach Tommy about the importance of truth and the power of words.</p><p>With <i>Mr. Peabody's Apples</i>, her gorgeous sophomore venture into the realm of children's literature, Madonna sustains her transformation from material girl to mom. Inspired by a 300-year-old Ukrainian story and illustrated by the talented Loren Long, Madonna's tale is about the dangers of gossip. As a frequent target of the rumor mill, who better to teach the young ones about the "power of words" and their potential to cause "harm to others" than the newly reformed diva?<p> Set in a tiny American town, Madonna's story features the big-hearted and much beloved Mr. Peabody, an elementary school teacher and Little League coach who dedicates his summer Saturdays to the local losing team. The kindly teacher seems to savor life the way he savors his weekly apple--taking pleasure in the little things. One weekend after the game, Tommy Tittlebottom watches Mr. Peabody take his apple without paying for it. The following weekend Tommy calls in reinforcements to witness Mr. Peabody's transgression. By the next Saturday, Mr. Peabody's apparent theft has become grist for the Happville rumor mill and no one comes to Little League practice. These moments truly highlight Long's talents as an illustrator--the handsome Mr. Peabody (part Harry Connick Jr., part Robert Redford) comes to life on the page, his disappointment as palpable as that of Billy Little, the young boy who idolizes him. A simple explanation puts the rumors to rest, but as Mr. Peabody points out in a poignant demonstration, small talk can often lead to big trouble for everyone.</p><p> In a wonderful departure from her debut children's book <i>The English Roses</i>, Madonna has created a tribute to 1940's small-town America that delivers a fundamental message about respecting others. Children will love Mr. Peabody and parents will appreciate the gentle nudge with which he delivers his message. <i>Mr. Peabody's Apples</i> unfolds slowly, but readers young and old will want to linger over each illustrated page lovingly rendered in a muted pallet of rich color. <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>Madonna is an international celebrity - pop star, film star and mother.

Tolkien.</p> <p>Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely travelling further than the pantry of his hobbit-hole in Bag End.</p> <p>But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard, Gandalf, and a company of thirteen dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an unexpected journey &#x2018;there and back again&#x2019;. They have a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon...</p> <p>The prelude to The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit has sold many millions of copies since its publication in 1937, establishing itself as one of the most beloved and influential books of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><i>"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."</i> <p> The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a "little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves." He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, "looking for someone to share in an adventure," Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure.</p><p> The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, would eventually spring. Though <i>The Hobbit</i> is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too. By the time Bilbo returns to his comfortable hobbit-hole, he is a different person altogether, well primed for the bigger adventures to come--and so is the reader. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p><b>Scenes from <em>The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies</em></b></p> <em> </em> Luke Evans as Bard and Orlando Bloom as Legolas in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, in theatres December 17, 2014.

She ventured fearlessly beyond familiar poetic subjects to tackle political injustice, social discrimination, and women's sexuality in her poems and prose. In the 1920s and '30s, Millay was considered a spokesperson for personal freedom in America, particularly for women, and we turn to her lines to illuminate the social history of the period and the Bohemian lifestyle she and her friends enjoyed. </p><p>Yet Millay's poetry is still decisively modern in its message, and it continues to resonate with readers facing personal and moral issues that defy the test of time: romantic love, loss, betrayal, compassion for one another, social equality, patriotism, and the stewardship of the natural world. </p><p><em>Collected Poems</em> features Millay's incisive and impassioned lyric poetry and sonnets, many of which are considered among the finest in the language, as well as the poet's last volume, <em>Mine the Harvest</em>, compiled and published in 1956 by her sister Norma Millay.</p>Edna St. Vincent Millay was born in 1892 in Rockland, Maine, the eldest of three daughters, and was encouraged by her mother to develop her talents for music and poetry. Her long poem "Renascence" won critical attention in an anthology contest in 1912 and secured for her a patron who enabled her to go to Vassar College. <p>After graduating in 1917 she lived in Greenwich Village in New York for a few years, acting, writing satirical pieces for journals (usually under a pseudonym), and continuing to work at her poetry. She traveled in Europe throughout 1921-22 as a "foreign correspondent" for <em>Vanity Fair.</em> Her collection <em>A Few Figs from Thistles</em> (1920) gained her a reputation for hedonistic wit and cynicism, but her other collections (including the earlier <em>Renascence and Other Poems</em> [1917]) are without exception more seriously passionate or reflective. </p><p>In 1923 she married Eugene Boissevain and -- after further travel -- embarked on a series of reading tours which helped to consolidate her nationwide renown. From 1925 onwards she lived at Steepletop, a farmstead in Austerlitz, New York, where her husband protected her from all responsibilities except her creative work. Often involved in feminist or political causes (including the Sacco-Vanzetti case of 1927), she turned to writing anti-fascist propaganda poetry in 1940 and further damaged a reputation already in decline. In her last years of her life she became more withdrawn and isolated, and her health, which had never been robust, became increasingly poor. </p><p>She died in 1950.</p></p><h2>The Hanged Man: Psychotherapy and the Forces of Darkness</h2><p>SCIENCE AND BEHAVIOR NOVEL</p><p></p><h2>Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, Incredible Cross-Sections (The Definitive Guide to the Craft from Star Wars Episode III)</h2><p>Peel back high-tech layers to reveal the cockpits, engines, hyperdrives, and construction secrets of more than eighteen vehicles from the newest Star Wars feature film.</p><p>Dr. Curtis Saxton is the author of <i>Star Wars: Attack of the Clones Incredible Cross-Sections</i>. <br> Highly acclaimed illustrators, Richard Chasemore and Hans Jenssen have co-illustrated four <i>Star Wars Cross-Sections</i> and three <i>Inside the Worlds of Star Wars</i> books for DK.</p><h2>Daughter of Suqua</h2><p>Everyone in Suqua, a village on the Puget Sound, is related to one another in some way and part of a tightly knit community due to these cultural and family ties, but when the government steps in, the entire town knows that great changes are about to come to their way of life.</p><p>Grade 4-5?It is 1905, and Ida, 10, lives with her parents and grandmother among their people, the Suquamish, on an island off the coast of Washington. The story revolves around their struggle to maintain their identity; first as a family, and second as a tribe when the U.S. government resettles them on allotted lands and enrolls their children in "American" schools. Readers will identify with Ida's need to be with her friends and family and her despair over being sent away to a white boarding school. They will be enriched by her tenacity and the cultural values she exhibits, like cooperation and mutual responsibility. Like Regina in Sally Keehn's I Am Regina (Philomel, 1991) and Walnut in Michael Dorris's Sees Behind Trees (Hyperion, 1996), Ida is a fully realized character whom readers will care about. Hamm has done her homework, and her story is rich in Suquamish history and lore. It includes dialect that is used successfully because it is used sparingly. However, children won't read the book for its historical value, but because they will want to know what is going to happen to Ida.

The old woman would mime the donning of clothes, and help him again and again and again to perform the basic tasks. No matter how he tried, the man could not button the buttons of his shirt. He failed again and again. But, if he was failing, the expression of the old woman seemed to say: This, what we are doing, it is the hardest thing in the world. No one has ever done it.

And soon, he had learned to scrub as well. Soon, he could do it by himself.<br> &nbsp;<br> If one waited some days and looked through the bottom windows, a different scene might present itself. The two sat at a long table, and blocks with pictures of things were passed back and forth. Large bound sheets full of pictures were shown and shared.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes a task would be terribly difficult&#x2014;terribly, terribly difficult, and the man would cry. He would sit down on the floor and cry. Then the old woman would sit down beside him on the floor and wait, and when he was done crying, they would try again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her patience was the heart of it. She was as patient as a person could be.<br> &nbsp;<br> ++<br> &nbsp;<br> The house was a tall Victorian house. That meant it was nicely made, and with good proportions. The rooms had high ceilings. The windows were large and bore many panes within their cavities. The floors had long wooden boards that ran the length of each room. Many were covered with fine carpets. When a person trod on the floors, the boards creaked, and in this way the house was a little bit alive.<br> &nbsp;<br> Along the stairs there were photographs. At each step there was another photograph. By walking up and down the stairs one could find a sort of history&#x2014;but of what it was hard to say. There were many photographs of machines. Winged machines, wheeled machines, farm machines. There were many people with somber clothing and blurry faces. Sometimes there were many people together in one photograph, and when there were, they usually all stood facing in the same direction. How could the photographer stand in front of them&#x2014;so many, and not be noticed?<br> &nbsp;<br> The banister was of a swooping brown wood and felt very pleasant under the hand. One could run the hand along it, all the way down the stairs, and then one would be at the bottom. All the way from the top to the bottom.<br> &nbsp;<br> The bottom of the stairs faced a long, narrow hall&#x2014;and at its end a door that was never open. This door was set with colored glass of every sort. It would be a nice place to lie, to lie flat on the back in the hall and be covered with the colored light.<br> &nbsp;<br> There were two paintings in this hall&#x2014;one of a bird with long feathers, and another of a woman who wore clothing that made her look very much like a bird. She was angry, and her face was cruel, and she filled the area around the door with her anger.<br> &nbsp;<br> Many of the windows in the house had seats in them. The seats were covered in cushions, and a person could sit there as long as they liked. Eventually, the sun might become blinding. Or, the sky would become dark. Then it would be time to go to a different place.<br> &nbsp;<br> The woman who walked about in the house was very old. She was always watching everything that happened, and always listening. She was a comfort because she would be there in an instant to help, or she would wait for hours until the next time she should be there in an instant to help. She wore dark stockings of wool and no shoes. Her clothes were the same color as the walls.<br> &nbsp;<br> The kitchen was the airiest room in the house. It had many windows, and they looked out on a garden full of plants. Some things from the garden would end up in the kitchen. There were many times when one could leave the kitchen happily, and one would often come into it with great happiness, too. The kitchen was the best room in the house.<br> &nbsp;<br> There were many places in the house for putting things. One could put things from one place to another, and they would go back to the place they had been before. This was a sort of game. As many times as one would do it, the things would return. Even paintings that were tilted, or hairs placed under small statues.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man would get up and go to the stairs at first, and he would wait there, and wait until she came and then they would go down the stairs together. Or, later, he would go down sitting, go down sitting all the way. He had a hard time making his legs and arms work like the old woman could. Whenever she wanted to do something, she did it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Finally, he could go down the stairs just like her. In fact, he could go down faster than that. He would go down the stairs and the old woman would find him and they would have things to do all day and then it would be time to sleep.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whenever he didn&#x2019;t have things to do, the old woman found something for him to do. But when he had something to do, she was never there.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man liked the pants that he wore, and there was a day when he put all the clothes on by himself and came down the stairs by himself, and worked on a thing he had decided to do by himself and ate by himself and it was not until the evening that he saw her. Then they sat on the closed porch and she lit a candle and it was a sort of celebration.<br> &nbsp;<br> ++<br> &nbsp;<br> And on the seventieth day, the man spoke.<br> &nbsp;<br> ++<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Can I, the water.<br> &nbsp;<br> The examiner sat quietly looking at the claimant. She said nothing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Can you give me the water?<br> &nbsp;<br> His words were clear and distinct.<br> &nbsp;<br> She picked up the pitcher of water with both hands and gravely presented it to him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Here you are, she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Thank you, said the claimant.<br> &nbsp;<br> The examiner nodded and went back to what she had been doing as if nothing remarkable at all had just happened.</p><h2>Billie B.

Her mother, indeed, is of the opinion that the girl has grown all too attached to the products of her imagination and decides to send her away from London for a restorative dose of fresh country air. But staying at Thackers, in remote Derbyshire, Penelope is soon caught up in a new mystery, as she finds herself transported at unforeseeable intervals back and forth from modern to Elizabethan times. There she becomes part of a remarkable family that is, Penelope realizes, in terrible danger as they plot to free Mary, Queen of Scot, from the prison in which Queen Elizabeth has confined her.<br> &nbsp;Penelope knows the tragic end that awaits the Scottish queen but she can neither change the course of events nor persuade her new family of the hopelessness of their cause, which love, loyalty, and justice all compel them to embrace. Caught between present and past, Penelope is ever more torn by questions of freedom and fate. To travel in time, Penelope discovers, is to to be very much alone. And yet the slow recurrent rhythms of the natural world, beautifully captured by Alison Uttley, also speak of a greater ongoing life that transcends the passage of years.&nbsp;<br><br></p></p><p><p>Alison Uttley (1884&#x2013;1976) was born Alice Jane Taylor in Derbyshire, England, into a tenant farming family that had lived on the same land for two hundred years. Uttley would return to the Derbyshire landscape and the house she grew up in, Castle Top Farm, in many of her books, including <i>A Traveller in Time</i>. A bright scholarship student throughout her childhood, Uttley went on to Manchester University, and in 1906 became the second female student to graduate with honors in<br> physics from the university. Marriage and motherhood put an end to her teaching career, and it was only after her son, John, began school that she published her first book, <i>The Squirrel, the Hare and the Little Grey Rabbit </i>(1929). Uttley&#x2019;s husband died the next year, and she began publishing books at a rapid rate in order to support herself and her son. Among her works are naturalistic novels of youth, adventure tales, and a cookbook, as well as books that grew out of her belief in enchantment, time travel, and the supernatural. By the end of her life, Uttley had written some one hundred books of fiction and nonfiction, including thirty in the Little Grey Rabbit series, and become one of twentieth-century Britain&#x2019;s most popular children&#x2019;s writers.<br> Phyllis Bray (1911&#x2013;1991) was an English painter, illustrator, and muralist.

Tips for color combinations and layering and combining different fabrics (i.e., silks, linens, and cottons, but rarely polyesters), as well as patterns, finishing tips, and diagrams, are included.

Furthermore, Celtic art is one of Europe&#x2019;s great artistic traditions, with the skills of Celtic craftspeople standing alongside the best of the ancient and medieval worlds. <br>&nbsp;<br>But who were the Celts? Recent research and new archaeological discoveries are continuing to transform our understanding of the idea of the Celts &#x2013; a subject involving much controversy and academic debate since the late 1990s. Drawing on the latest scholarship, the authors explore how the Celts have been defined differently from ancient times to the modern day, by people with different perspectives and agendas. They look, too, at what is meant by Celtic art, from its origins c.500 BC in western Europe, through its transformations and revivals in the Roman, Anglo-Saxon and medieval periods, to its rediscovery in Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Over 250 remarkable objects have been selected from the collections of the British Museum, the National Museums of Scotland and other key European museums to richly illustrate the narrative and highlight the artistic accomplishments of craftspeople through the centuries. Here are iconic, intricately decorated masterpieces as well as less well-known fixtures and fittings; items of warfare and adornment; the ceremonial and the utilitarian.</p><p></p><h2>The West: An Illustrated History</h2><p>This is the companion volume to the stunning PBS TV series from Stephen Ives and Ken Burns. The book features over 400 illustrations, many of them never before published, in magnificent color. In a vivid narrative that begins with the arrival of the first Europeans and ends well into the 20th century, Ward provides a gripping journey through the turbulent history of the region that has come to symbolize America around the world. Drawing upon hundreds of letters, diaries, memoirs, and journals as well as the latest scholarship, THE WEST chronicles the arrival of wave after wave of newcomers from every direction of the compass. The cast is as rich and diverse as the western landscape itself--explorers, soldiers, Indian warriors, settlers, railroad builders and gaudy showmen. Coronado, Custer, Jesse James, Chief Joseph, Brigham Young and Buffalo Bill are all here. So are scores of lesser-known westerners whose stories are no less compelling--a Chinese ditchdigger. a rich Mexican landowner, a forty-niner from Chile, a Texas cowboy born in Britain, a woman missionary to the Indians who loathed the West and a Wellesley graduate who loved it in spite of everything it did to her and her family. It is the central story of America, a story filled with heroism and hope, enterprise and adventure as well as tragedy and disappointment. THE WEST explores the tensions between whites and the native peoples they sought to displace, but it also encompasses the Hispanic experience in the West from the time of the conquistadors to the transformation of a Mexican-American village called Los Angeles into the region&#39;s major metropolis, the lives of Chinese immigrants who called the region &#34;Gold Mountain&#34;, and the ordeals of freed slaves from the South who sought a better life homesteading on the Great Plains.

This is the first thing that has ever excited me. The more I think about it, the more certain I am of it. I can learn as I go, learn from my mistakes. I&#x2019;ll take all the advice I can get. I know it&#x2019;s sudden, but Grandpa&#x2019;s death made this crystal clear for me.&#x201d;<br>Virginia looked at him long and hard and then let out a soft sigh.<br>She turned to Mae. &#x201c;And where are you in all this craziness?&#x201d;<br>Just then the waitress returned for their orders. &#x201c;Ok a y, honey, what&#x2019;ll it be?&#x201d; she asked Peter, who blushed at her endearment.<br>&#x201c; I&#x2019;ll have the special, but could I get mashed potatoes instead of the creamed corn?&#x201d; Peter said, realizing he hadn&#x2019;t even looked at the menu.<br>&#x201c; Sure thing.&#x201d; She shrugged her shoulders. She pointed to Mae with her pencil.<br><br>Mae ordered a Reuben sandwich, and Virginia opted for the roast pork dinner. Then the waitress disappeared again. They could hear her raspy voice call out the order to the cook.<br>Mae&#x2019;s eyes met Peter&#x2019;s. She began, &#x201c;To be honest, I&#x2019;m not as sure as<br>Peter is. Living with my parents isn&#x2019;t working out, and I&#x2019;m glad to see<br>Peter excited about something. But I&#x2019;m a city girl, and truthful l y, I&#x2019;m worried about fitting in, in a small town.&#x201d; She squeezed his hand.<br>&#x201c;At least you&#x2019;re honest,&#x201d; Virginia said, tilting her head in thought.<br>Then she stared Peter in the eye. &#x201c;You remind me of your grandpa.&#x201d;<br>Peter smiled, and then Virginia continued, &#x201c;He was stubborn too. And he was a dreamer. But he loved farming. Maybe that&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;ve always been my favorite&#x2013;don&#x2019;t tell your cousins.&#x201d; She wrinkled her nose. &#x201c;But<br>I don&#x2019;t know ... &#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You said it was Grandpa&#x2019;s dream to have someone in the family take over for him.&#x201d; Peter knew he was begging, but he couldn&#x2019;t help himself.<br>Virginia chuckled quietly. &#x201c;Using my own words against me&#x2013;it&#x2019;s not fair. &#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d pay whatever you feel the farm is worth. &#x201d;<br>&#x201c; Oh hush,&#x201d; Virginia said. She thought for a moment. &#x201c;You are right&#x2013;I would rather keep it in the family, but this would be a big change for you. You haven&#x2019;t grown up farming like most of the men a round here. There&#x2019;s no telling if you&#x2019;ll still like it a month from now.<br>Anything seems better if you&#x2019;re looking to get away from a bad situation in St. Paul. Let&#x2019;s not rush into such a big commitment so fast.&#x201d;<br>She paused to consider. &#x201c;What would you say to a trial period? Say if you worked the farm for a season? I&#x2019;d charge you rent, same as any other farmer. A hundred dollars an acre per year plus rent on the house and barn. I imagine we&#x2019;ll have to take out an operating loan, but the monthly check from the creamery and the money you get when you sell the crop should offset that. I can show you Roy&#x2019;s books so you&#x2019;ll know what kind of numbers we&#x2019;re talking here. If you can keep the operation profitable, and you and Mae&#x201d;&#x2013;she shifted her gaze &#x2013; &#x201c;decide you like the work and living in Lake Emily, we could talk about a long-term arrangement. But I don&#x2019;t want you to have unrealistic expectations. Farming isn&#x2019;t an easy life. T h e re&#x2019;s long hours and plenty of rough spots.&#x201d;<br>She was actually saying yes. Peter sat forward in his seat, his face beaming. &#x201c;That sounds great! What do you think, Mae?&#x201d; He turned to his wife.<br>&#x201c;Watch out, honey,&#x201d; the waitress interrupted, &#x201c;these plates are coming in hot and heavy!&#x201d; She set their meals in front of them. &#x201c;You must love mashed potatoes.&#x201d; The waitress glanced at Peter.<br>There were two huge scoops of potatoes on his plate, one cove red with beef and gravy on top of a slice of bread, the other with just gravy.<br>Chagrined, he looked over at his grandmother as the waitress disappeared again. &#x201c;I guess I didn&#x2019;t know what a beef commercial was,&#x201d; Peter admitted sheepishly.<br>&#x201c; She didn&#x2019;t get us any silverware either,&#x201d; Virginia said. She scooted over on the vinyl seat and got up to rob some from a nearby table.<br>After Peter said grace, Virginia continued, &#x201c;Now, where we re we?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think we&#x2019;re waiting to hear from Mae,&#x201d; Peter said.<br>Mae took a deep breath and began, &#x201c;When Pastor Hickey carried that baby to the old woman&#x2013;Evelyn, wasn&#x2019;t it?&#x2013;there was something that really spoke to me. I felt God whispering in my ear that I need to take a new look at things. I don&#x2019;t know what that all means, but I&#x2019;m not so afraid anymore. I guess what I&#x2019;m saying is, I&#x2019;m willing to give it a try. &#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What about your job at the flower shop?&#x201d; Peter asked.<br>&#x201c; Seemed there was always plenty of work for me at the farm with-out traipsing to town for more&#x2013;but then you young people do things differently nowadays,&#x201d; Virginia said.<br><br>&#x201c; I&#x2019;ll look around and see what I can find nearby. I&#x2019;m not in a hurry to start a new job, but I&#x2019;m sure we could use the income.&#x201d;<br>Peter couldn&#x2019;t seem to stop smiling. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re talking like this is a done deal,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;I suppose it is,&#x201d; Virginia said.<br>&#x201c; So when do we start?&#x201d; Peter said.<br>&#x201c; Bert Biddle has been taking care of things for a while now, so I guess the sooner the better. How does tomorrow sound? Bert can teach you the ropes better than I can&#x2013;and he&#x2019;s a bit more agile at tossing bales around the hayloft and getting the cows into the barn.&#x201d; She winked. &#x201c;Milking starts around six. That okay?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c; Is that A.M.?&#x201d; Mae asked. Virginia and Peter both laughed.<br>&#x201c;Would you like to come over too, Mae? Not at six, of course, but maybe after you get off work, while the men do their evening milking.<br>We could have coffee and get better acquainted,&#x201d; Virginia said.<br>&#x201c; I&#x2019;d like that,&#x201d; Mae said.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to do what?&#x201d; Catherine was incredulous. Mae had known her mother would react this way. It was the whole reason she&#x2019;d wanted to put off telling her.<br>&#x201c;We talked to Peter&#x2019;s grandmother, and we&#x2019;ve decided to move to<br>Lake Emily to run the family farm.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c; Peter doesn&#x2019;t know anything about farming. This is a failed proposition before it even starts. What makes him think he&#x2019;ll make any money milking cows? &#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one who said he needed to get out there. &#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And work his way up the corporate ladder, not the hayloft! How could you have agreed to such a lame brained scheme? You&#x2019;ll be miserable out in the middle of nowhere. &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c; I&#x2019;ll be happy as long as I&#x2019;m with Peter,&#x201d; Mae retorted.<br>&#x201c; For how long?&#x201d; Catherine responded. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re young. A husband can&#x2019;t be your happiness forever. At some point you&#x2019;re going to wake up and discover that he has flaws. You have so much promise. What about your cello? I thought you we re going to pursue your music once you graduated from college.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That was your dream, Mom. I don&#x2019;t have any passion for it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You limit yourself, Mae. And now you&#x2019;re going to waste away in some boring little backward town. &#x201d;<br>Mae didn&#x2019;t know what made her more angry&#x2013;being told she had no common sense or being treated like a child.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to end up just like your sister. &#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know how Trudy pushes me to see how much of her craziness<br>I&#x2019;ll take.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c; Craziness? Mom, she&#x2019;s a teacher. She loves kids. She&#x2019;s creative, intelligent, and happy. Why isn&#x2019;t that enough? You honestly think she lives her whole life to spite you? &#x201d;<br>&#x201c; She&#x2019;s irresponsible. I was hoping for better from you. Mae, farming is a hard life. It&#x2019;s ... it&#x2019;s beneath you. Why would you want this for yourself? &#x201d;<br>&#x201c; It isn&#x2019;t only hardship, Mom. T h e re&#x2019;s a lot that&#x2019;s good about farming &#x2013; &#x201d;<br>&#x201c; Peter,&#x201d; Catherine exhaled. &#x201c;I knew he&#x2019;d bring you trouble. Doesn&#x2019;t he care about you at all, look out for what&#x2019;s best for you? This is going to tear your marriage apart. &#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mother!&#x201d; Mae shouted as tears filled her eyes. &#x201c;Peter&#x2019;s my husband and I love him. He isn&#x2019;t dragging me away against my will. I want to do this, so don&#x2019;t blame him!&#x201d; Her face turned hot. She&#x2019;d never spoken back to her mother. Her daughter-guilt pointed its gnarled finger at her. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to try to come between us this way, then I&#x2019;m afraid&#x2013;&#x201d; Her words broke off. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid&#x2013;&#x201d; She knew what she needed to say, and<br>yet her courage waned.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Catherine&#x2019;s mouth hung open.<br>&#x201c;That this is the end of our relationship.&#x201d; There. She&#x2019;d said it, yet she immediately regretted her words.<br>Catherine sputtered. &#x201c;You would put him before your own mother?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want this any more than you do, Mom, but you&#x2019;re forcing me to choose.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;re saying this. I only want what&#x2019;s best for you. &#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s best for me is that I make my own decisions, Peter and I together, whether you agree or not.&#x201d;</p><h2>Party in My Tummy: A Lift-the-Flap Book (Yo Gabba Gabba!)</h2><p>Based on the popular song, <i>Party in My Tummy </i>makes healthy eating fun for little ones!

Sadie&#x2019;s lover calls her as he drives to meet his wife at marriage counseling. Gwen pines for her roommate, a man who will hold her hand but then tells her that her palm is sweaty. And Sasha agrees to have a drink with her married lover&#x2019;s wife and then immediately regrets it. These are the women of <i>Single, Carefree, Mellow</i>,<i> </i>and in these eleven sublime stories they are grappling with unwelcome houseguests, disastrous birthday parties, needy but loyal friends, and all manner of love, secrets, and betrayal. <br>&nbsp;<br>In &#x201c;Cranberry Relish&#x201d; Josie&#x2019;s ex&#x2014;a man she met on Facebook&#x2014;has a new girlfriend he found on Twitter. In &#x201c;Blue Heron Bridge&#x201d; Nina is more worried that the Presbyterian minister living in her garage will hear her kids swearing than about his finding out that she&#x2019;s sleeping with her running partner.

She lives in Washington, D.C., with her husband and children. This is her first book.THE DIVE BAR<br><br>So picture Sasha innocently sitting alone in her apartment on a hot summer afternoon and the phone rings. She answers and a woman says, &#x201c;This is Anne.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; says Sasha.<br><br>&#x201c;I think you know,&#x201d; Anne says.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Sasha is not trying to be difficult. She honestly doesn&#x2019;t know. She is trying to think of possible Annes whose voices she should recognize. Is it someone she missed an appointment with? Is this the owner of that camera she found in a cab last month and kept&#x2014;�<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Carson&#x2019;s wife,&#x201d; Anne says.<br><br>Sasha says, &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; And even if she sat around from now until eternity saying Oh! every few seconds, she would never be able to inject it with as many layers of significance and wonder again.<br><br>&#x201c;I was thinking we ought to have a drink,&#x201d; Anne says. And to paraphrase Dr. Seuss, Sasha does not know quite what to say. Should she meet her for drinks? Now what should she do? Well, what would you do if your married lover&#x2019;s wife asked you?<br><br>After the phone call, Sasha finds she is too agitated to stay in the apartment, so she calls her roommate, Monique, at work. Monique is just leaving, so they decide that Sasha will walk down Broadway from 106th Street and Monique will walk up Broadway from Thirty-�sixth, and they will have a drink in whichever establishment they happen to meet in front of.<br><br>Because Sasha is anxious, she walks faster than Monique and they end up meeting in front of a Taco Tico on Sixty-�fourth Street, but they cheat slightly and go into an Irish bar next door.<br><br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; says Monique when Sasha tells her about Anne&#x2019;s phone call. &#x201c;That must have been so humiliating for her when you didn&#x2019;t recognize her name.&#x201d;<br><br>Sasha frowns slightly. Isn&#x2019;t Monique supposed to be on her side about this? Besides, it wasn&#x2019;t that she&#x2019;d forgotten Anne&#x2019;s name, it was that Carson never used it. Always he said my wife. I have to go, my wife is expecting me. Let me call my wife and tell her I&#x2019;ll be late.<br><br>&#x201c;And how did she know your name?&#x201d; Monique asks.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess Carson told her that when he told her about me,&#x201d; Sasha says.<br><br>&#x201c;So when are you meeting her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Next Wednesday.&#x201d;<br><br>Monique looks startled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a long way away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think so, too,&#x201d; says Sasha. &#x201c;But she was all sort of businesslike and obviously flipping through a calendar, saying, &#x2018;Now let&#x2019;s see when can I fit you in,&#x2019; and next Wednesday was evidently the first opening.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think she&#x2019;s planning to murder you?&#x201d; Monique asks, finishing the last of her beer.<br><br>&#x201c;No, because we&#x2019;re meeting at a bar on Amsterdam and Ninety-�ninth,&#x201d; Sasha says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like she&#x2019;s luring me to some remote underpass.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not to change the subject,&#x201d; Monique says, digging into her bag and pulling out a brochure. &#x201c;But will you come with me to this singles volunteer thing tomorrow? We&#x2019;re refurbishing a brownstone for a needy family.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you were doing that singles grocery night thing,&#x201d; Sasha says. &#x201c;On Thursdays.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I was until last Thursday!&#x201d; Monique says, looking all het up. &#x201c;When I had this long intense talk with a man in the checkout line and it turned out he works for Lambda Legal and was just there because he needed salad stuff.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They should limit entrance to the store on those nights,&#x201d; Sasha says.<br><br>&#x201c;So will you come with me?&#x201d; Monique says. &#x201c;Or, unless, I guess, now that Carson has left his wife, maybe you&#x2019;re not single anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>This sounds vaguely insulting, and more than a little negative, so Sasha says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;<br><br>After meeting Monique, Sasha takes the subway down to Carson&#x2019;s club, where he&#x2019;s been staying for the past two weeks. Sasha loves his club&#x2014;�the threadbare stateliness of it, the way the staff flirt with her, the masculine rooms. She doesn&#x2019;t care if he lives there forever.<br><br>She happens to meet Carson in the lobby, where he is collecting his mail, and in the elevator, she tells him about the phone call.<br><br>He looks startled. &#x201c;She called you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, and asked me out for a drink.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t think you should go,&#x201d; Carson says. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not a nice drunk.&#x201d;<br><br>The elevator stops and some other people get on, so Sasha is left to digest this piece of information in silence. Anne is not a nice drunk. She can add this to the only other two details Carson has ever revealed about Anne, which is that she works as an administrator for a nonprofit charity for the homeless and that it drives him crazy the way she never empties the fluff out of the dryer filter. Sasha wonders if it&#x2019;s some sort of flaw in her character that she was never more curious about Anne. Shouldn&#x2019;t she have been fascinated, eaten up by jealousy, followed them on marital outings?<br><br>Once they get to Carson&#x2019;s room, she says, &#x201c;How is she not a nice drunk?&#x201d;<br><br>Carson is flipping through his mail. &#x201c;She just repeats herself endlessly. But she repeats herself endlessly when she&#x2019;s sober, too.&#x201d;<br><br>Another piece of information! Maybe Sasha should have been asking questions all along. &#x201c;But why do you think she wants to meet me? Is she going to murder me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; says Carson, dumping his mail on the desk. &#x201c;She might bore you to death, but otherwise you&#x2019;re pretty safe.&#x201d;<br><br>The fact that Carson finds Anne so boring is slightly shocking to Sasha. It seems to her that Carson is interested in everything. You could tell him a story without one single redeeming feature, like that the man at the bodega gave you Canadian money for change, and he would say, &#x201c;Really? Which bodega was that?&#x201d; (This actually happened to Sasha last week and she put the coins in her wallet and keeps accidentally trying to buy stuff with them and being yelled at by street vendors all over Manhattan.) The idea that Carson could be bored by anyone, let alone someone who maybe loves him, is distressing.<br><br>&#x201c;And why did you tell her my name, anyway?&#x201d; Sasha asks.<br><br>&#x201c;She asked,&#x201d; Carson says. &#x201c;The night I told her about the affair. She said, &#x2018;Tell me about her, I want to know about this person who&#x2019;s so important to you.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Sasha says nothing. Carson told his wife about the affair two weeks ago. He said he hadn&#x2019;t meant to do it, but they were discussing their marriage and she was being all nice and sympathetic and told him he could tell her if there was someone else, that she would understand. Since then, he has said, somewhat cryptically, that her attitude seems to have &#x201c;undergone a change.&#x201d; Even just thinking about this, it is hard for Sasha not to shake her head at the universal stupidity of men.<br><br>Sasha and Carson go out to dinner, just like a married couple. Well, maybe not a married couple, but a legitimate couple, at least, not caring anymore if anyone sees them. During dinner, he asks about the book Sasha is writing and Sasha is suddenly conscious of being boring. Should she be talking about Syria, or global warming?<br><br>It&#x2019;s only due to Carson that Sasha writes books at all. He was the one who encouraged her when an editor approached her about writing young adult romance novels, who told her, who cares if it&#x2019;s YA, you&#x2019;re still making a living by writing, and he was the one who sent her two dozen salmon-�colored roses during the weekend in which she had to read two dozen young adult romances so that she could write the next one in the series. (She did it, too, though sometimes she feels she was never the same afterward.) And now Sasha, who never even had much of a job before, has a career, of sorts, and is offered four-�book contracts and gets to stay home all day in her pajamas and really loves what she does. Also, Carson has proven exceptionally good at trouble-�shooting plot issues. The only person better at it is Monique, but she gets upset if Sasha doesn&#x2019;t use her ideas, and Carson doesn&#x2019;t seem to care. He can reel off a dozen possible solutions and doesn&#x2019;t mind if she rejects them all.<br><br>So she tells him that all the characters in this book live on an island and she needs to find a way for all of them to miss the last ferry home, and they discuss that for the rest of dinner.<br><br>Then they go back to Carson&#x2019;s room and get ready for bed, brushing their teeth together (another married couple thing!) and Carson spits in the sink and says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to go apartment-�hunting tomorrow, and I was hoping you&#x2019;d come with me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have to go to this volunteer thing with Monique,&#x201d; Sasha says, without planning to. &#x201c;I already promised.&#x201d;<br><br>Sasha and Monique show up at the brownstone for the singles volunteer day, along with about thirty other people. The renovation is being run by a short and short-�tempered redheaded man named Willie, who seems ready to shout at any of them with the slightest provocation. Sasha can understand why he&#x2019;s so grouchy, though: he has to oversee a bunch of volunteers who are all busy checking one another out instead of doing home repair. She almost feels a little sorry for the needy family who is going to move in, picturing the very low standard to which their new home will be refurbished.<br><br>Willie assigns them partners of the opposite sex and sets them to work on various tasks. Sasha&#x2019;s partner is a tall blond guy named Justin and their task is to remove the wallpaper in the living room. Every fifteen minutes, Willie blows a whistle and you can switch if you don&#x2019;t like your task (or, more likely, your partner, Sasha suspects).<br><br>Sasha and Justin mainly ignore each other and get on with their task. Even after the whistle blows four times, they&#x2019;re still working together. But when they finally take a break and go to the water cooler, Justin looks at her for a moment and Sasha suddenly knows, with an instinct born of long experience, that he is about to tell her that he has a girlfriend or to ask for her phone number. Or both.<br><br>And sure enough, Justin says in a low voice, &#x201c;I have to tell you something. I&#x2019;m not really single. I just came here because my friend Paul didn&#x2019;t want to come alone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me, too,&#x201d; Sasha says. She hopes they are not going to have some long discussion about their respective relationships.<br><br>But Justin doesn&#x2019;t mention his girlfriend again. He only says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking maybe I should have a singles volunteer day at my apartment. It needs repainting and a whole bunch of other stuff.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Cartoon Classics Collection Volume 1: The Flintstones Bedtime Storybook</h2><p>5 stories on some cartoon favorites.</p><p></p><h2>Down These Strange Streets</h2><p><b>All new strange cases of death and magic in the city by some of the biggest names in urban fantasy. </b><p>In this all-new collection of urban fantasy stories, editors George R.R.

But these are more than just good stories. They lay the groundwork for God's relationship with humanity and for his plan for our salvation, making Genesis foundational to understanding everything else that happens in the Bible.</p><p>Genesis reveals much about human nature and the nature of God. From the actions of the first man and woman, we see where our rebellious, sinful nature originates. And through the whole book we see the hand of a sovereign God who is loving and merciful, but also just and holy. Time and again in Genesis, God showers his grace upon undeserving humanity, giving us our first tastes of God's enduring faithfulness that shines throughout the entire Bible.</p><p>R. Kent Hughes, respected pastor and author of many other commentaries in the Preaching the Word&nbsp;series, takes readers back to the beginning of the Bible and moves through Genesis with careful exegesis. He explores the superbly crafted structure of the book as well as the weighty themes it contains.

Here is an eyewitness account, in the tradition of George Orwell's <em>Homage to Catalonia</em>.</p><p>The spontaneous rising of Hungarian people against the Hungarian communist party and the Soviet forces in Hungary in the wake of Stalin's death, while ending unsuccessfully, demonstrated to the world at large the failure of Communism. The Russians were obliged to use force on a vast scale against armed students, factory workers, and intellectuals in the streets of a major European capital to restore the Hungarian communist party to power. For two weeks, students, women, and teenagers fought tanks in the streets of Budapest, in full view of the Western media&#x2014;and therefore the world&#x2014;and for a time they actually won, deeply humiliating the men who succeeded Stalin. The Russians eventually managed to extinguish the revolution with brute force and overwhelming numbers, but never again would they attempt to use military force on a large scale to suppress dissent in their Eastern European empire.</p><p>Told with brilliant detail, suspense, occasional humor, and sustained anger, <em>Journey to a Revolution</em> is at once history and a compelling memoir&#x2014;the amazing story of four young Oxford undergraduates, including the author, who took off for Budapest in a beat-up old Volkswagen convertible in October 1956 to bring badly needed medicine to Budapest hospitals and to participate, at street level, in one of the great battles of postwar history. Michael Korda paints a vivid and richly detailed picture of the events and the people; explores such major issues as the extent to which the British and American intelligence services were involved in the uprising, making the Hungarians feel they could expect military support from the West; and describes, day by day, the course of the revolution, from its heroic beginnings to the sad martyrdom of its end.</p><p><em>Journey to a Revolution</em> delivers "a harrowing and horrifying tale told in spare and poignant prose&#x2014;sometimes bitter, sometimes ironic, always powerful."*</p><p>* Kirkus Reviews (starred)</p></p><p><p>Michael Korda is the author of <em>Ulysses S. Grant</em>, <em>Ike</em>, <em>Hero</em>, and <em>Charmed Lives</em>. Educated at Le Rosey in Switzerland and at Magdalen College, Oxford, he served in the Royal Air Force. He took part in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and on its fiftieth anniversary was awarded the Order of Merit of the People's Republic of Hungary. He and his wife, Margaret, make their home in Dutchess County, New York.</p>In October 1956 the Hungarian people spontaneously rose up against an oppressive Soviet-imposed Communist regime and basked briefly in the light of freedom. In this history lesson&#x2013;cum&#x2013; memoir, Korda (<i>Another Life</i>) stitches an appealing retelling of his journey of discovery into the larger context of the desperate, short-lived Hungarian revolt. Part hard-nosed history lesson, part affectionate celebration of Hungary and Hungarian culture, and part sepia-tinged memoir, the book attempts to pull back the veil on the post-WWII machinations of the victorious Allies and expose how such diplomatic wheeling and dealing can devastate an entire nation. The first two-thirds are strong, with both a comprehensive overview of the postwar geopolitical scene and a finely tuned take on the specifics of the Hungarian situation. Korda's account of his own journey there during the revolution at age 24 is strangely flat. Along the way from the pastoral comfort of his native England to the rubble and corpse-strewn streets of Budapest, he has some near misses with life-threatening danger. At the border between Austria and Hungary, Korda and his mates encounter a machine gun&#x2013;toting guard who offers them <i>barack</i>, homemade peach brandy, and a warning about the invading Russians: "there are some very bad guys in Gy�r." While the tale at times has difficulty rising from the page, Korda's story is a worthy read. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When you live in a 150-year-old inn, you do. Guests bang around in their rooms, the pipes thump and clank in the walls, and the wind sometimes moans as it slithers past the eaves. </p><p>But I'd never heard anything from the attic before. </p><p>I sat bolt upright and glanced at the clock on the night table. </p><p>3:32. Biscuit hissed at the ceiling, her eyes glowing in the clock's greenish light. I fumbled for the bedside lamp and switched it on. The tabby's ginger-colored tail had puffed up to three times its normal size, and the fur on her back bristled. </p><p>Blood thundered in my ears as I sat motionless, listening. The waves slip-slapped against the rocks below the inn, and a stray breeze whispered past the window, but the ceiling above me lay silent. As the minutes stretched by, my body relaxed. It was prob-ably just the wind. </p><p>I was reaching to turn off the light when it happened again. A soft thump, right over my head. I jerked my arm back and grabbed a fistful of down comforter, pulling it up to my chin. There had been nothing in the "How to Run a Bed and Breakfast" manual about dealing with freeloading guests in the attic. Or ghosts. </p><p>Several months ago, as we sat in the warm yellow kitchen downstairs, my friend Charlene had told me that the inn was sup-posed to be haunted. Since the only annoying manifestations to date had been demanding guests who didn't pay their bills, I had shrugged it off. </p><p>The whole ghost idea had a bit more credence alone in my bedroom on a moonless October night. My tongue felt thick in my mouth as I swallowed. A moment later, the thump was fol-lowed by a creak from the boards above my bed. </p><p>Biscuit bolted from the bed and scrabbled at the bedroom door. A creak answered from above, and she made a low sound deep in her throat before abandoning the door to scuttle under the white dust ruffle of my bed. I wanted to cram myself in beside her, but I didn't think I'd fit. </p><p>My eyes shot to the phone on the dresser. I could call my neighbor, John. He was the island's deputy. He would be here in five minutes, and I could join Biscuit under the bed and let him deal with the attic. </p><p>It was tempting, but I hesitated. John and I had started seeing each other recently, and I didn't want him to think I was pulling the damsel-in-distress routine. I glanced down at my faded flannel nightshirt. If John did come over, it would be pretty obvious that seduction wasn't my goal. Or that if it was, I wasn't very good at it. </p><p>I listened for a few moments more, but whatever was up there had fallen silent. Why had I tossed out my pepper spray? When I lived in Texas, I kept a small canister in my night table drawer. While packing to move to Maine, though, I pitched it, along with several pairs of legwarmers and the paperback edition of The Smart Woman's Guide to Finding Mr. Right. </p><p>Tonight, as I slipped out from under the covers and eased my-self onto the icy wood floor, I was wishing I hadn't been so thor-ough. Another board creaked overhead. Adrenaline shot through me. Pepper spray probably wasn't effective on ghosts anyway. If it was a ghost. </p><p>The cold air on the bare skin of my calves made my goose bumps grow a few sizes larger as I slid open the night table drawer and dug for the flashlight. Power outages on Cranberry Island were common enough that I kept a flashlight by the bed, and my hand quickly closed on the familiar plastic cylinder. I flicked the switch. Nothing. </p><p>Cursing, I rifled through the drawer again. My hand closed on a matchbox and I was fumbling for a candle when I spotted an old book light in the jumble. I grabbed it and flipped it open. A weak circle of watery light gleamed on the floor. It would have to do. </p><p>I crept to the bedroom door and turned the cold knob. The door squeaked as it swung open, and something brushed against my ankle. A scream froze in my throat when I glimpsed a flash of orange tearing down the hall. </p><p>I was headed toward the attic, but Biscuit wasn't about to join me. For the first time, I wished I had chosen a large dog, some-thing in the Doberman family, instead of a chubby orange tabby cat as an animal companion. </p><p>As I tiptoed down the hallway toward the hatch in the ceiling, something clattered above me. Ghost, my mind whispered. Pol-tergeist. I hadn't thought about ghost stories for years, but now my mind churned up every spooky tale I had ever heard: the footsteps of small children, desperate to escape from phantom flames; the shades of women murdered by jealous husbands; tortured souls who had hanged themselves in a basement or an attic. An attic. </p><p>Nonsense. How could you walk across the attic if you were stuck hanging from the rafters? It was probably just a squirrel. A big squirrel. </p><p>As I reached for the pull cord, I reflected that I hadn't seen any squirrels around the Gray Whale Inn. The ceiling creaked again as my hand closed around the end of the string. If whatever was up there was a squirrel, it had been doing some major steroids. </p><p>I drew a ragged breath and jerked the hatch down toward me. The rusted hinges screeched in protest. I yanked the ladder open, and a black hole yawned above me. I thrust the book light up and played the feeble beam over the dusty rafters. Nothing. I fought the urge to run back to my room and bury myself under the cov-ers. Instead, I forced one shaky foot onto the bottom rung. </p><p>You're a thirty-nine-year-old woman. Whatever's up there, you can handle it. I climbed the ladder cautiously, and my head was soon immersed in cold, empty darkness. I shone the pale light all around the attic. The wavering beam illuminated two broken lad-der-back chairs, a rusted iron headboard, and a dilapidated hat-box. The air shuddered out of my chest. It must have been a squir-rel, after all. </p><p>Then I ran the beam across the floorboards above my bedroom. </p><p>I knew I had heard footsteps. But the thin film of dust on the floor above my room lay undisturbed. I woke the next morning with a start. It was 7:40; I had overslept by more than an hour. I hurled myself out of bed, wriggled into a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt, and sprinted down the stairs to the kitchen. In the pale light of morning, last night's wild imaginings seemed far away. The early sun reflected off the antique pine floors, mak-ing the buttery yellow walls glow. As I filled the coffeemaker's glass carafe and glanced at the mound of sheets and towels peeking out from behind the laundry room door, I felt a twinge of misgiving. Polly Sarkes usually came and helped me with the laundry twice a week, but she hadn't shown up yesterday morning. </p><p>Polly had lived on the island her entire life. Her broad, cheer-ful face, surrounded by a halo of hair that frizzed up when it was humid, was a welcome sight in the mornings&#x2013;and she was a housecleaning whiz. I'd hired her in July, when the number of dirty towels the inn produced started to give me nightmares about piles of soiled linens creeping up the stairs to smother me in my bed. Although the laundry had receded to a manageable level and I no longer needed help&#x2013;in fact, I really couldn't afford it&#x2013;I knew that Polly needed the work, and I couldn't bring myself to let her go. </p><p>In her early forties, Polly had never married, devoting her sub-stantial warmth and affection to the cats she cared for. Polly was practical, cheerful, and very thorough. Which was why I was wor-ried; it wasn't like Polly not to show up without calling, and she wasn't answering her phone. </p><p>My eyes lingered on the overflowing laundry baskets. If Polly didn't call this morning, I would go looking for her. </p><p>A few minutes later, the soothing aroma of freshly ground Moka Java and the reassuring gurgle of the coffeemaker filled the kitchen. </p><p>I reached into the refrigerator and pulled out eggs and butter for Peach Sunrise Coffee Cake, one of my favorite recipes. I glanced at the clock; it was already a quarter to eight. If I hurried, I could have the cake out of the oven just before nine. Breakfast officially started at 8:30, but with any luck, my guests would come down late. </p><p>The summer season at the Gray Whale Inn, the bed and break-fast I had started six months earlier, had been good, but the steady stream of guests had dried to a trickle after Labor Day. My stomach lurched when I thought of the unbooked months ahead. Between the heating bills and the mortgage, I needed at least a few guests over the winter if I wanted the inn to survive until spring. Maybe I would have to look for a part-time job. Doing what, I wondered? Knitting hats for the local gift shop? I didn't knit, but if the book-ings didn't start coming, there might be plenty of time to learn. </p><p>I was searching for the sour cream when the kitchen door creaked behind me. I whirled around, heart thumping, but it was only Biscuit. She gazed up at me with wide green eyes and me-owed as she sidled over to me, wrapping herself around my calves as if she hadn't abandoned me in my hour of need. "Traitor," I muttered as I bent down and rubbed her head. </p><p>As I filled a bowl with dry cat food and pushed the pantry door closed, the creak of the hinges sent a chill down my back. I thought what I'd heard last night had come from the attic, but could it have been something on the roof? I shivered slightly as I unwrapped the butter and plopped it into a large bowl. I didn't believe in ghosts, but last night had given me the creeps. </p><p>I glanced out the window. The rising sun had ignited the russet and gold of Mount Cadillac on the mainland, and the stretch of cold seawater beneath it was stippled with the pale peach of early morn-ing. I tore my eyes from the window and rooted through the drawer for the beaters. There would be plenty of time to admire the view later. I had just located the beaters when the kitchen door creaked again. </p><p>I turned quickly, brandishing a wooden spoon, and stifled a groan. So much for late-rising guests. Candy Perkins stood at the door, a pink tee shirt stretched tight across her ample bosom. Her bright, cotton-candy smile and artificially rosy cheeks made her look like an overgrown Shirley Temple. My eyes drifted toward her chest. A well-developed, overgrown Shirley Temple. </p><p>"Good morning, Nat!" She spoke in a squeaky, bubbly voice I had always associated with teenaged girls. She walked over to the well-scrubbed pine farm table, pulled out a sparkly notepad and a purple pen, and sat down. </p><p>Her curly blonde hair was still wet from a shower and framed her round, pink face like a mass of corkscrews. My eyes strayed down to her tee shirt; today's slogan was "Girls Just Want to Have Funds." "Hi, Candy." I tried to return her perky smile. "You're up early." </p><p>"I hope you don't mind," she chirped. "I thought I'd watch you go through your morning routine and take some notes." Candy had been staying at the inn for three days now. She was an aspiring bed-and-breakfast owner, and had decided to pick the Gray Whale Inn as a study subject. At first, I had been flattered. But after sev-enty-two hours of Candy watching my every move, I was feeling a bit stifled. "Mind if I have a cup of coffee?" she asked. </p><p>I nodded toward the coffee pot. "Help yourself. Mugs are up on the shelf. Cream is in the fridge, and the sugar bowl is next to the pot." </p><p>"Oh, no sugar and cream for me." She patted her flat belly lightly. "Carbs go right to my waistline." As she trotted past me toward the coffee, she peered at the mixing bowl with interest. "What are we making today?" </p><p>"Peach Sunrise Coffee Cake," I said, determined to be friendly. "It's one of my favorite recipes." </p><p>"Wow," she said, surveying the ingredients. "That's a lot of but-ter. And sour cream, too?" </p><p>"Uh-huh." I lowered the beaters into the bowl and grimaced. Nothing spoiled a good coffee cake like a skinny person looking over your shoulder and staging an impromptu lecture on the dan-gers of fat grams and carbohydrates. Candy hadn't reached her stride on the subject yet, but I knew it was imminent. </p><p>Candy poured herself a cup of coffee and minced back to the table as the beaters whirled, transforming the eggs and milk into a pale gold liquid. I turned the mixer off and reached for the flour, blotting all thoughts of calories from my mind and anticipating the flavor of the moist cake, drenched in butter and brown sugar and studded with peaches. </p><p>Candy's voice floated over my shoulder. "What else is on the menu?" </p><p>I glanced back at her. "Cheesy scrambled eggs, sausage patties, and broiled grapefruit." </p><p>Candy's eyes flitted to my waist, which I had to admit was a bit larger than it used to be. "Gosh. I don't know how I'm going to keep my figure in this business," she said. </p><p>I tugged down my sweatshirt and turned on the mixer again as I assembled the dry components. I was pleased to discover that the whir of the beaters made further conversation impossible. By the time I turned the mixer off, the eggs and milk were practically foam. </p><p>"Have you ever considered low-carb breakfasts?" Candy piped up as soon as the beaters stopped. She looked pointedly at my midriff. "It might help." </p><p>I smiled and turned the beaters back on again while I cut the butter into the flour mixture, letting them run until the last pos-sible moment. The cake might be a tad chewy, but the silence was worth it. </p><p>Quickly, I assembled the layers of batter, peaches, and rasp-berry cream. I had just poured the last of the batter over the rows of sliced peaches and slid the pan into the oven when the phone rang. I said a small prayer of thanks&#x2013;now that the mixer was off, I could see Candy preparing to launch into her favorite topic again&#x2013;and grabbed for the receiver. </p><p>"Good afternoon, Gray Whale Inn." </p><p>"Afternoon? It's not even eight o'clock." I smiled at the bright voice of my best friend, Charlene Kean. In addition to her du-ties as postmistress and gossip queen, she also owned and ran the only grocery store in town. She wasn't what I had expected in a Mainer&#x2013;her taste in clothes was more Neiman Marcus than L. L. Bean, and she regularly took large consignments of Mary Kay cos-metics&#x2013;but we had become fast friends almost from the moment I set foot on the island. </p><p>"Sorry, Charlene. I'm a little short on sleep." I cracked an egg into a large mixing bowl as I spoke. I was about to tell Charlene about the noises in the attic, but glanced at Candy, whose blue eyes were still tracking me, and stopped myself. "What's up?" I asked instead. </p><p>"I didn't get a chance to call you yesterday, but I've got a special delivery down here for you," she said. </p><p>"A special delivery? What is it?" </p><p>"I don't know, but it's in a styrofoam cooler. Says it has to be frozen after forty-eight hours. I stuck it in the freezer. The return address is some town in Texas." </p><p>Texas? I had spent fifteen years working for the Texas Depart-ment of Parks and Wildlife in Austin, but I wasn't expecting any deliveries from that part of the world. </p><p>I emptied another egg and discarded the shell. "That's strange." </p><p>"Do you want me to bring it out to you?" Charlene asked. "Or are you coming down to the store later?" </p><p>I eyed the tub of home-baked toffee squares I had been plan-ning to take down to C...</p></p><h2>Anglo-Saxon Chronicles</h2><p>History book.</p><p></p><h2>Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit: A Jeeves and Bertie Novel</h2><p>The ingenius valet Jeeves aids Bertie Wooster in and out of various crises, including a stolen necklace in Bertie&#39;s possession and the unthinkable possibility of getting married</p><p>Against a stormy, <i>Wuthering Heights</i> sort of background, a giant drama begins to unfold, involving, among other things, Bertie's possession of a stolen necklace and the soul-shattering prospect of a trip to the marriage altar.P.

There's no game involved--such as finding a number of objects or watching the numerals bend or become something else. The point is to square the number: ``8 `octos' on the ocean floor/ Have scrambled legs, 64.'' The full-color illustrations are realistic , but they don't add much feeling of animation or movement. Older children may find the math presentation a nice change of pace, but as a picture book, this is a bit ambitious. --Christine A.

But nobody much wants Zen to succeed: not the local authorities, who view him as an interloper, and certainly not Miletti&#39;s children, who seem content to let the head of the family languish in the hands of his abductors -- if he&#39;s still alive.Was Miletti truly the victim of professionals? Or might his kidnapper be someone closer to home: his preening son Daniele, with his million-lire wardrobe and his profitable drug business? His daughter, Cinzia, whose vapid beauty conceals a devastating secret? The perverse Silvio, or the eldest son Pietro, the unscrupulous fixer who manipulates the plots of others for his own ends? As Zen tries to unravel this rat&#39;s nest of family intrigue and official complicity, Michael Dibdin gives us one of his most accomplished thrillers, a chilling masterpiece of police procedure and psychological suspense.</p><p><b>Ruth Rendell</b> wrote of <b>Ratking</b>:<p>"Tremendously exciting ...

Why do certain figures out of folklore and myth haunt specific locales? Do borders around a nation parallel borders around the heart? Do wastelands and depleted landscapes delineate gaps in the collective imagination? Why have so many indigenous cultures insisted on the world&#39;s aliveness? And if the world is alive, how does it let us know? To explore such questions, Craig Chalquist calls for a new perspective of deep encounter, terrapsychology, which shows us how to listen into recurring symbolic resonances between the inner person and the presence, voice, or soul of places and things which embody the animation of the world. In this perspective the health of the places where we live corresponds closely to the pockets of health inside and between us.

He moved with his wife to a remote mountain farm in the Alpujarras, south of Granada, and writes about his life on a mountain with no access road, water supply or electricity.</p><p>When English sheep shearer Chris Stewart (once a drummer for Genesis) bought an isolated farmhouse in the mountains outside of Granada, Spain, he was fully aware that it didn't have electricity, running water, or access to roads. But he had little idea of the headaches and hilarity that would follow (including scorpions, runaway sheep, and the former owner who won't budge). He also had no idea that his memoir about southern Spain would set a standard for literary travel writing. <p> This rip-roaringly funny book about seeking a place in an earthy community of peasants and shepherds gives a realistic sense of the hassles and rewards of foreign relocation. Part of its allure stems from the absence of rose-colored glasses, mainly Stewart's refusal to merely coo about the piece of heaven he's found or to portray all residents as angels. Stewart's hilarious and beautifully written passages are deep in their honest perceptions of the place and the sometimes xenophobic natives, whose reception of the newcomers ranges from warm to gruff.</p><p> After reading about struggles with dialects, animal husbandry, droughts, flooding, and such local rituals as pig slaughters and the rebuilding of bridges, you may not wish to live Chris Stewart's life. But you can't help but admire him and his wife, Ana, for digging out a niche in these far-flung mountains, for successfully befriending the denizens, and for so eloquently and comically telling the truth. The rich, vibrant, and unromanticized candor of <i>Driving over Lemons</i> makes it a laudable standout in a genre too often typified by laughable naivet�. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i></p>"Fortunately, there's no shortage of can-do Brits who are willing to tough it out for the enjoyment of readers everywhere.

On this voyage, Sindbad and his hapless crewmates are driven off course, and their ship is overrun by monkeys. They abandon the ship but row into more trouble, landing on an island inhabited by a man-eating giant. They are captured but devise a daring escape, and think they are almost away, when they encounter even greater obstacles. With his ingenuity and quick wits, Sindbad prevails, but there are yet more seafaring adventures in store.<br><br>Sindbad earned top marks from critics and readers alike for its breath-taking art. In <i>Sindbad in the Land of Giants</i>, Ludmila Zeman has once again delivered an action-packed, suspenseful tale worthy of <i>The Thousand and One Nights</i>.</p><p><b>Ludmila Zeman</b> is an award-winning author, artist, and filmmaker. Her trilogy retelling of the story of Gilgamesh won international awards and has numerous foreign-language editions. The art from all three of the Gilgamesh books was displayed at the Bologna Book Fair. Born in the Czech Republic, Ludmila Zeman now lives in Montreal.Gr 2-5-Continuing the tales begun in her Sindbad (Tundra, 1999), Zeman retells another yarn from A Thousand and One Nights. Despite vows to stay put, the sailor finds the call of adventure too great and sets off on a disastrous voyage. Driven off course by cruel winds, he and his crewmates wash up on the terrifying Mountain of the Monkeys. From there, it's all downhill for the luckless crew-the men encounter a castle garnished with human bones, a terrible beast with eyes like fire and a taste for raw sailor, serpents and sea creatures, and more-will Sindbad ever escape? And how? The story only takes hapless readers so far, before promising more in a future book. Engagingly written, the story is fleshed out by Zeman's pencil, colored-pencil, and watercolor illustrations. Richly detailed, with intricate borders, the pictures are strongly reminiscent of Near Eastern miniatures, thus evoking the culture from which the story springs. Readers will pore over the art, drawing detail from it to enhance the text. John Yeoman's The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor (McElderry, 1997) is a broader work, and certainly Quentin Blake's illustrations provide a contrast in style. But for those who like adventure stories with gorgeous artwork, this title is a sound addition to folklore collections.<p></p><p><i>Ann Welton, Terminal Park Elementary School, Auburn, WA</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Civil War: A Narrative, Vol. II: Fredericksburg to Meridian</h2><p><b>Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best nonfiction books of all time</b><br><br>The first volume of Shelby Foote's tremendous narrative of the Civil War was greeted enthusiastically by critics and readers alike (see back of jacket for comments).

Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the kingdom of Phthia. Here he is nobody, just another unwanted boy living in the shadow of King Peleus and his golden son, Achilles. Achilles, &#39;best of all the Greeks&#39;, is everything Patroclus is not - strong, beautiful, the child of a goddess - and by all rights their paths should never cross. Yet one day, Achilles takes the shamed prince under his wing and soon their tentative companionship gives way to a steadfast friendship. As they grow into young men skilled in the arts of war and medicine, their bond blossoms into something far deeper - despite the displeasure of Achilles&#39;s mother Thetis, a cruel and deathly pale sea goddess with a hatred of mortals. Fate is never far from the heels of Achilles. When word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, the men of Greece are called upon to lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, Torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows Achilles into war, little knowing that the years that follow will test everything they have learned, everything they hold dear. And that, before he is ready, he will be forced to surrender his friend to the hands of Fate. Profoundly moving and breathtakingly original, this rendering of the epic Trojan War is a dazzling feat of the imagination, a devastating love story, and an almighty battle between gods and kings, peace and glory, immortal fame and the human heart.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2012</strong>: Betrayal, ardor, war, and prophecies--in <i>The Song of Achilles</i>, author Madeline Miller brings together everything I love about <i>The Iliad</i> without the labor of epic poetry. In this new twist on the Trojan War story, Patroclus and Achilles are the quintessential mismatched pair--a mortal underdog exiled in shame and a glorious demigod revered by all--but what would a novel of ancient Greece be without star-crossed love? Miller includes other good tragic bits--foreknowledge of death, ruthless choices that pit pride and reputation against the lives of innocents, the folly of men and gods--and through her beautiful writing my spine chilled in the presence of Achilles&#x2019; mother, the sea goddess Thetis, and I became a bystander in the battlefield of Troy awash with blood, exaltation, and despair. <i>The Song of Achilles</i> infuses the essence of Homer with modern storytelling in a combination that is utterly absorbing and gratifying--I can&#x2019;t wait to see what Miller tackles next. <i>--Seira Wilson</i> <br><br> <strong> Gregory Maguire Interviews Madeline Miller</strong><br> <p><strong> Gregory Maguire is the best-selling author of <em>Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister</em>, <em>Lost, </em><em>Mirror Mirror, </em> the Wicked Years, a series that includes <em>Wicked</em>, <em>Son of a Witch</em>, <em>A Lion Among Men</em>, and most recently, <em>Out of Oz</em>. </strong></p> <p><strong> Gregory Maguire:</strong> Ms. Miller, you write with the confidence of the zealously inspired, taking as your material one of the great foundation texts of world literature. In three millennia, <em>The Iliad</em> has garnered somewhat wider attention than <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, with which I have played, so I have to ask: where do you get the noive? How did you come to dare to take on such a daunting task, and for your first book?</p> <p><strong> Madeline Miller:</strong> A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and in my case it was just dangerous enough to get me started. If I had stopped to ponder, I think I might have been too intimidated. But it helped that Patroclus is such an underdog&#x2014;giving him voice felt like standing up for him. I had been intensely frustrated by a number of articles that kept side-stepping the love between him and Achilles, which to me felt so obviously at the story&#x2019;s heart. So I wanted to set the record straight, as I saw it.</p> <p><strong> Maguire:</strong> The novel tells the story of the rise, fall and immortalization of the golden Achilles. You approach his famous story from a sideline, that of Patroclus, his bosom companion and lover. Was it hard to keep the mighty arc of legend from overwhelming shadowy Patroclus, and did you write more of him than you ended up using, just to be sure you had him firmly grounded in your mind?</p> <p><strong>Miller:</strong> Definitely yes to the second. I actually spent five years writing a first draft of the novel, took a good long look at it, then threw it out and started from scratch. Even though not a word survived, that draft was an essential first step. It helped me understand the story and characters, especially Patroclus, from the inside out.</p> <p>As for the overwhelming legends, I actually think they worked in my favor&#x2014;because Patroclus is overwhelmed by them himself. He is this ordinary person who is pulled into a terrifying world of angry deities and destiny because of his love for Achilles.</p> <p><strong>Maguire:</strong> Having glancingly heard of this legend before, I knew more or less how it would end. I had no idea how you might handle the loss of perspective and point of view when tragedy would inevitably strike. You managed to narrate an almost impossible transition from life into myth in part, I think, by your instinctual use of a combination of present and past tense, to say nothing of a masterly combining of authorial and first person observations. How many slaughtered bulls did you sacrifice, and on whose altar, to deserve the talent to risk such dangerous technique?</p> <p><strong>Miller:</strong> It was a lot of bulls. And whatever ended up working, I give all the credit to my background in theater. When I first started writing, I had this idea that I should be in control of the story, forcing it forward. It never worked. What I needed to do was learn how to get in character, and write from there.</p> <p>It took me a long time to find just the right tone for the ending&#x2014;I kept writing and throwing away, writing and throwing away. Then, in the middle of apartment-hunting, inspiration struck. All the other ideas had started out well, but would gum up before they got anywhere near the finish line. But this one kept humming right along. And it was the simplest, so there you go.</p> <p></p> <p><strong> Maguire:</strong> Oscar Wilde said something like, &#x201c;The Odyssey was written by Homer, or another Greek of the same name.&#x201d; But Oscar Wilde had clearly not met you. This is not a question. It is a salute.</p><p>The legend begins...</p><p><em>Greece in the age of heroes.</em> Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the kingdom of Phthia to be raised in the shadow of King Peleus and his golden son, Achilles. &#x201c;The best of all the Greeks&#x201d;&#x2014;strong, beautiful, and the child of a goddess&#x2014;Achilles is everything the shamed Patroclus is not. Yet despite their differences, the boys become steadfast companions. Their bond deepens as they grow into young men and become skilled in the arts of war and medicine&#x2014;much to the displeasure and the fury of Achilles&#x2019; mother, Thetis, a cruel sea goddess with a hatred of mortals.</p><p>When word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, the men of Greece, bound by blood and oath, must lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the Fates will test them both as never before and demand a terrible sacrifice.</p><p>Built on the groundwork of the <em>Iliad</em>, Madeline Miller&#x2019;s page-turning, profoundly moving, and blisteringly paced retelling of the epic Trojan War marks the launch of a dazzling career. </p></p><h2>Lighthouses of the Great Lakes: Your Ultimate Guide to the Region&#39;s Historic Lighthouses (Pictorial Discovery Guide)</h2><p>Join Todd R.

Murder in Dealey Plaza masterfully exposes the fallacies of the Warren Commission Report through objective, incontrovertible, medical, scientific, and investigative analyses of both old and new evidence. The conclusions are as solid as the credentials and research experience of the contributing authors. It is time that the truth in the JFK assassination be revealed and that Unites States history be rewritten. <br>--Cyril Wecht, M.D., J.D.; Past President, American Academy of Forensic Sciences </p><p>Murder in Dealey Plaza is a deeply disturbing book which documents the deceit and deception that marked the government's handling of the evidence in the Kennedy assassination. The authors, all highly skilled professionals, describe the cover-up, from the falsification of the autopsy results to the alteration of the Zapruder film.

As the Stones approach their half-century milestone, such contemporary artists as Ke$ha, Kanye West, and the Black Eyed Peas pay musical homage to Jagger&#x2014;none more memorably than Maroon 5&#x2019;s Adam Levine and Christina Aguilera, who added their voices to the mounting crescendo of musical tributes with &#x201c;Moves Like Jagger.&#x201d; First performed on the hit NBC reality TV show The Voice in June 2011, &#x201c;Moves Like Jagger&#x201d; zoomed to number one.

A Street Fighting Man? The Midnight Rambler? A Man of Wealth and Taste? All this, it turns out, and far, far more. By any definition, Mick Jagger is an original, one of the dominant cultural figures of our time. Swaggering, strutting, sometimes sinister, always mesmerizing, he grabbed us by our collective throat a half century ago and&#x2014;unlike so many of his gifted peers&#x2014;never let go.<br> <br>Jagger is arguably the last of the rock titans, although even that description sells him short. Over the past half century&#x2014;from the tumultuous sixties and hedonistic seventies to the booming eighties and no-holds-barred nineties to hardscrabble 2012&#x2014;Mick seeped into the pores of the culture in a way few others have.<br> <br>To baby boomers and subsequent generations, Mick was a fun-house mirror reflection of every phase, fad, movement, and trend. Once the Beatles paved the way with their squeaky-clean brand of youthful rebellion, the Stones gloried in being dirty, scruffy, raunchy, and rude. Students took to the streets to protest the war in Vietnam, and Mick supplied them with rage-filled anthems.<br> <br>No group epitomized the sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll ethos of the psychedelic era more than the Stones. And when the occult was added to the mix, Mick wrapped himself not in some mystic&#x2019;s robes but in Lucifer&#x2019;s crimson cloak.<br> <br>His macho street fighter image behind him, Mick became an avatar of androgynous chic, wearing mascara and lipstick and exploring his bisexual side. This, in turn, morphed seamlessly into the disco era, when Mick slipped his bony frame into white satin jumpsuits, bathed himself in glitter, and belted out dance hits between hits of cocaine.<br> <br>The &#x201c;Just Say No&#x201d; eighties of Ronald Reagan brought another shape-shift for Jagger. Now Mick was a family man, and staunchly antidrug. &#x201c;Why,&#x201d; he now claimed with a straight face, as if the previous thirty years hadn&#x2019;t happened, &#x201c;I never really did any of those things.&#x201d;<br> <br>As it turned out, more than Mick&#x2019;s lips were larger than life. Everything he did both on and off stage seemed to be bigger, faster, louder. As the lead singer of the Rolling Stones, he sang, pranced, strutted, vamped, and yes, swaggered, before more people than anyone in history. By 2010, of the ten highest-grossing concert tours of all time, the Rolling Stones occupied spots one, three, four, five, and nine.<br> <br>Then, of course, there were the records&#x2014;an astounding 250 million albums sold&#x2014;and the annual polls never failing to rank the Rolling Stones as the greatest rock-and-roll band of all time. Which, logically, made Mick the number one rock vocalist of all time.<br> <br>Offstage Mick did not disappoint, living the sybaritic life of an arrogant, self-obsessed, seemingly out-of-control rock star to the hilt. The public dramas and private heartaches were detailed meticulously by a ravenous press, along with the wretched excesses of Mick&#x2019;s private life: the lavish homes and limousines, the private jets and yachts, the drugs, the women&#x2014;and sometimes the men. But especially the women.<br> <br>Along the way, Mick used skills he learned as a student at the London School of Economics to help the band earn billions and make its members all absurdly rich&#x2014;in Mick&#x2019;s case, to the tune of $400 million. He also slavishly pursued his dream of being accepted into the highest circles of British society&#x2014;a quest that, in time, earned him a knighthood.<br> <br>For essentially his entire adult life, this vocal enemy of the Establishment has also been cozy with England&#x2019;s aristocracy&#x2014;just one in the mind-spinning tangle of contradictions that make up Jagger the man.<br> <br>Mick is the suburban English schoolboy who exploded on the scene singing blues from America&#x2019;s heartland; the gym teacher&#x2019;s son who became the poster boy for unfettered hedonism; the street tough with the refined tastes of a proper English gentleman; the androgynous dabbler in bisexual love with boundless heterosexual appetites; the knight of the realm who for fifty years has reveled in his worldwide image as rock&#x2019;s rebel emeritus, the legendary Lothario whose most important and enduring human relationship is with another man who claims not to understand him at all: Keith Richards.<br> <br>As the Rolling Stones celebrated their fiftieth anniversary, Jagger remained one of the most written about, talked about, and speculated about people on the planet. Yet, incredibly, he succeeded in cultivating the one thing that all true icons have in common: a powerful mystique.<br> <br>It is, in the end, that singular, galvanic force of nature&#x2014;a charismatic creature who would have achieved stardom with or without the Rolling Stones&#x2014;who continues to mesmerize, excite, and enthrall us after a half century. Scandal, money, drama, music, fame, drugs, sex, and genius&#x2014;all this and more are embodied in the man whose very name defines an era. That man is Jagger. That man is Mick.</p><h2>Eudora Welty: The Collected Stories</h2><p>This complete collection includes all the published stories of Eudora Welty. There are forty-one stories in all, including the earlier collections A Curtain of Green, The Wide Net, The Golden Apples, and The Bride of the Innisfallen, as well as previously uncollected stories. With a Preface written by the Author especially for this edition.<br></p><p>One of the truly great works of twentieth-century American literature, Eudora Welty's Collected Stories confirms her place as a contemporary master of short fiction. Welty wrote novels, novellas, and reviews over the course of her long career, but the heart and soul of her literary vision lay with the short story. The forty-one pieces reproduced here, written over a period of three decades, include "A Petrified Man," "Why I Live at the P.O.,""The Wide Net," and "The Bride of Innisfallen." "I have been told," Welty writes in the introduction, "both in approval and in accusation, that I seem to love all my characters." The characters that spring to life in this masterwork reveal the depth and breadth of her love. <br>"Miss Welty's short stories are deceptively simple. They are concerned with ordinary people, but what happens to them and the manner of the telling are far from ordinary . . . A fine writer and a distinguished book. "--The New Yorker <br>"Eudora Welty is one of our purest, finest, gentlest voices and this collection is something to be treasured."--Anne Tyler <br>"The ironic tenderness of Chekhov, the almost feral edge of Maupassant, the ominousness of Poe and Bierce, the lacy strength of Henry Green. She is probably the finest Mozartian stylist writing in then English language."--Mary Lee Settle <br>"Stories as good in themselves and as influential on the aspirations of others as any since Hemingway's . . . The breadth of Welty's offering is finally most visible not in the variety of types-farce, satire, horror, lyric, pastoral, mystery-but in the clarity and solidity and absolute honesty of a lifetime's vision."--Reynolds Price <p><br>Eudora Welty (1909-2001) was born in Jackson, Mississippi.

She demonstrates the degree to which the profession defined itself in opposition to amateurism, femininity, and alternative ways of writing history. The male historians of the archive and the seminar claimed to be searching for "genderless universal truth," which in reality prioritized men's history over women's, white history over nonwhite, and the political history of Western governments over any other. Meanwhile, women amateurs wrote vivid histories of queens and accomplished women, of manners and mores, and of everyday life.</p><p>Following the profession up to 1940, <i>The Gender of History</i> traces the emergence of a renewed interest in social and cultural history which had been demeaned in the nineteenth century, when professional historians viewed themselves as supermen who could see through the surface of events to invisible meanings and motives. But Smith doesn't let late twentieth-century historians off the hook. She demonstrates how, even today, the practice of history is propelled by fantasies of power in which researchers imagine themselves as heroic rescuers of the inarticulate lower classes. The professionals' legacy is still with us, as Smith's extraordinary work proves.</p></p><p>In this pathbreaking study, Bonnie Smith shows how the practices of history, and indeed its very definition, have been shaped by gender. The male historians of the archive and the seminar prioritized men&#39;s history over women&#39;s, white history over non-white, and the political history of the Western governments over any other. From this environment Smith resurrects a neglected world of amateur history written by women, a world deemed trivial by their male counterparts, but one that holds essential lessons for our understanding of history today.Bonnie G.

During his 40-year career with the Home Office, he performed over 25,000 autopsies, and was involved in many high profile cases, including that of Fred and Rose West, and the child killer, Mary Bell. The author of numerous popular and academic non-fiction books, he has written thirteen novels in the Crowner John mystery series. Professor Knight lives in Cardiff.Knight, a retired British forensic pathologist, presents the first in a new medieval mystery series featuring Sir John de Wolfe. It's 1194, and Sir John has just been appointed coroner for the county of Devon. His first case unfolds when an unidentified, rotting corpse is discovered on a nearby riverbank, and no one knows who it is. The sheriff arrests a suspect, but Sir John is sure he's got the wrong man. When the corpse is identified as the son and heir of a rich country squire, the sheriff is determined to hang his suspect to curry favor with the squire. Can Sir John find the real killer in time to prevent a dire miscarriage of justice? Knight realistically depicts life in the twelfth century--physically demanding, harsh, violent, and raucous. His descriptions of injuries, corpses, and physical maladies are convincing and stomach-churning, but it's his gift for creating engaging and believable characters that makes the book such an enjoyable read. <i>Emily Melton</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The war&#x2019;s horror is relieved by the spirit of post-liberation Paris, where she indulged in frivolous fashions and recorded memorable conversations with Picasso, Cocteau, Eluard, Aragon, and Colette.

Inspired by Plains Indian culture, he was best known for writing stories about Native Americans, including <i>The Legend of the White Buffalo Woman</i>,<i> The Return of the Buffaloes</i>, and the Caldecott Medal&#x2013;winning<i> The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses</i>.Gr. 4^-8. In this picture book for older readers, Goble uses his characteristic decorative paintings to help retell an important sacred legend of the Lakota people. He describes a great flood, which killed almost all life on the earth, and relates how the nation came to be born again from the union of a woman of the earth and an eagle of the sky. He then explains how the people came upon hard and frightening times and tells of the arrival of the powerful White Buffalo Woman, who gave the Lakota people the Sacred Calf Pipe, a gift of the Great Spirit. The use of boldface headings and the braiding together of several myths interrupt the flow of the text, leaving readers to pick up additional meaning from the illustrations, but Goble fans, young and old, will enjoy the details in the clothing and landscape. The cartoonlike battle scene, with bloody, rolling heads, will certainly attract the attention of some young readers. In addition to notes regarding the significance of the tale, how he determined the style of clothing, and why he utilized specific related myths in his retelling, Goble lists primary and secondary sources. Additional information about Indian pipes is appended, as is a map pinpointing Pipestone Quarry, now a national monument. <i>Karen Morgan</i></p><h2>Ruins (The X-Files)</h2><p>As FBI agents Mulder and Scully investigate the disappearance of American archaeologist Cassandra Rubicon, who vanished while exploring the lost Mayan city of Xitaclan, a covert U.S. commando team is sent to destroy a strange electronic signal received from beneath the ruins.

The other half's three parts contain, respectively, short poems of observation, hortatory poems varying in length from epigram to six-page public epistle, and a brief verse play. The observational poems show the most variety of tone and form and may please the broadest range of readers. The play reprises the notion of personalized community integrity at the heart of Berry's novel <i>Jayber Crow</i> (2000) and extends it beyond death. The intervening exhortations, collectively called "Further Words," reflect Berry-the-prophet, by turns angrily haranguing ("The Ongoing Holy War against Evil"), justly explaining himself ("Some Further Words"), naturally moralizing ("Lysimachia Nummularia"), earnestly preaching ("Original Sin"), and oracularly commanding ("The Future," which probably should be read at every public meeting in the U.S.).

Frank Quitely has won acclaim for his work on high-profile titles including We3, JLA: Earth 2, The Authority, and New X-Men.*Starred Review* <i>Superman: All Star</i> is part of a new DC line that allows leading comics creators to present their own versions of the company's classic characters without acknowledging any of the baggage the icons have acquired over the decades. Morrison, currently comics' hottest scripter, gleefully seizes the opportunity to have his way with DC's flagship character. His affection for the <i>Superman</i> cast shines through on every page as he homes in on their iconic demeanors--quietly noble Superman, bumbling Clark Kent, suspicious Lois Lane, boyishly enthusiastic Jimmy Olsen, and brilliantly evil Lex Luthor. He even takes some of the loonier elements of the mythos, like Krypto the Superdog and Superman's robot duplicates, and gives them a goofy grandeur. Morrison substitutes a knowing intelligence for the naivete of the earlier comics and manages to toss in some of his own trademark megaconcepts, such as the Underverse, a layer of reality whose gravity is so heavy that in it time solidifies. Meanwhile, collaborator Quitely shows that he might be the perfect comic-book artist: subtle when necessary, cartoonish when appropriate, and adroit with the action sequences. Together, writer and artist devise a Man of Steel who is both respectfully classic and excitingly contemporary. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Faced with the prospects of a career-defining role and mentorship by a cinematic great, the 24-year-old Hollywood actor arrived in London armed with a large-format Roliflex camera&#x2013;inspired by Kubrick&#x2019;s early career as a <i>Look </i>photographer&#x2013;and a notebook to record his own on-set reportage; preparation for his starring role as a Marine Corps journalist.<br><br>But expectations eroded as a strange, creeping sickness pervaded the set, a horrific accident sidelined a principal, and an unexpected rivalry arose with a co-star.

Only now&#x2013;after two decades and the death of Kubrick&#x2013;can Modine look back on his images and words.

He supplies the answers throughout this diary on the movie's filming, which should provide new insights for Kubrick enthusiasts. Modine's writing isn't graceful, but his insider's view of events have enough acrid flavor and authenticity to compensate. He explains Kubrick's philosophy by quoting him, "There are no bad ideas&#x2014;only better ones," and convincingly highlights the fanatical perfectionism that caused Kubrick to go "dangerously overboard... way behind schedule." Modine mentions the horror of eating fruits and meats that were actually from the Vietnam War, kept in cans for 20 years. Other atmospherically effective details include the "incredibly uncomfortable, gummy and viscous" makeup blood, freezing in jungle fatigues and experiencing through Kubrick's emphasis on raw reality what the war was like. The book is filled with Modine's excellent photographs, which powerfully supplement the sometimes sketchy narrative. In the end, the work succeeds in expressing Modine's attitude&#x2014;"I'm going to make you feel the horror of death." The stainless steel&#x2013;covered book&#x2014;each one laser-etched with a serial number&#x2014;should become a collector's item for fans of the legendary director. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The architects of one of history&#x2019;s greatest atrocities speak out about their lives, their careers in the Nazi Party, and their views on the Holocaust. Their reflections are recorded in a set of interviews conducted by a U.S. Army psychiatrist. Dr. Leon Goldensohn was entrusted with monitoring the mental health of the two dozen German leaders charged with carrying out genocide, as well as that of many of the defense and prosecution witnesses. These recorded conversations have gone largely unexamined for more than fifty years.<br><br>Now, Robert Gellately&#x2013;one of the premier historians of Nazi Germany&#x2013;has transcribed, edited, and annotated the interviews, and makes them available to the public for the first time in this volume. <br><br>Here are interviews with the highest-ranking Nazi officials in the Nuremberg jails, including Hans Frank, Hermann Goering, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, and Joachim von Ribbentrop. Here, too, are interviews with the lesser-known officials who were, nonetheless, essential to the workings of the Third Reich. Goldensohn was a particularly astute interviewer, his training as a psychiatrist leading him to probe the motives, the rationales, and the skewing of morality that allowed these men to enact an unfathomable evil. Candid and often shockingly truthful, these interviews are deeply disturbing in their illumination of an ideology gone mad.<br><br>Each interview is annotated with biographical information that places the man and his actions in their historical context.

He lives in Tallahassee, Florida.Nuremberg&#x2014;Voices from the Past<br><br> Leon Goldensohn was an American physician and psychiatrist at the time the United States entered the Second World War. In 1943 he joined the U.S. Army and was soon posted to France and Germany, where he served in battles in the European theater. Not long after the war ended, he became prison psychiatrist at Nuremberg, the location of the first postwar trials of the major Nazi war criminals. Goldensohn arrived in Nuremberg in early January 1946, about six weeks into the trials, and remained there until late July of that year. As a trained psychiatrist he had responsibility for the mental health of the nearly two dozen German leaders who had survived the war and who were now fighting for their lives before the International Military Tribunal. As a medical doctor who saw the prisoners nearly every day, he also kept careful track of their physical problems. Over a period of seven months in Nuremberg prison he spoke on a regular basis with many of the twenty-one prisoners who were there when he arrived, and he carried out formal and extended interviews with most of them. In addition, he interviewed a large number of defense and prosecution witnesses, some of whom had also been significant Nazi officials.<br><br> This book publishes for the first time a broad selection of the interviews Goldensohn conducted during his time in Nuremberg. They represent an important addition to the record of the trials and of the Third Reich. They are unique in that they are systematic interviews conducted by a trained psychiatrist, and they offer new testimony about the mentality and motives of the major Nazi perpetrators.<br><br> Background to the Nuremberg Trials<br><br> The Nuremberg trials came into existence out of a multitude of political and judicial concerns, but are seen by many today as a landmark in international law. They were by no means inevitable, however, and might never have taken place. During the war, as Allied leaders learned about the vast scale of the Nazi atrocities, President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States, Prime Minister Winston S. Churchill of Great Britain, and General Secretary Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union at one time or another all considered summary execution as the more appropriate response to Nazi crimes.<br><br> The concept of the trials was apparently first suggested by Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov as far back as October 14, 1942. On that date Molotov wrote to several East European governments in exile in London about Moscow&#x2019;s inclination to try the most prominent leaders of &#x201c;the criminal Hitlerite government&#x201d; before a &#x201c;special international tribunal.&#x201d; Moscow was evidently upset that Britain was not willing to try Rudolf Hess, Hitler&#x2019;s deputy, who had flown to Scotland in May 1941, and the Soviets harbored fears that their allies might even conclude some kind of deal with Germany. For their part, the western Allies gave little thought to postwar trials, but continued to lean toward some kind of summary execution. Their immediate priority was winning the war.<br><br> Nevertheless, on November 1, 1943, all three Allies finally issued a joint statement about what should happen to the war criminals, in the so-called Moscow Declaration. It stated several general principles. For example, the declaration laid down that those who had committed crimes would be returned to the localities where these had taken place and be &#x201c;judged on the spot.&#x201d; Trial and punishment would follow the laws of the land in each locality. There would be different treatment for the major war criminals, however, whose crimes were seen as not restricted to any particular geographic area. The Moscow Declaration left up in the air precisely what ought to happen to these men and did not say whether there would be a trial or summary execution.<br><br> Churchill&#x2019;s own views were far from benign. He thought, as he said behind closed doors of a cabinet meeting on November 10, 1943&#x2014;just prior to the Tehran Conference&#x2014;that there was some point to drawing up a short list of specific war criminals. He was inclined to believe that dealing with this group summarily might shorten the war insofar as the named individuals would become isolated figures in their own country. This strategy required that the Allies avoid the entanglements of legal procedures, and Churchill himself favored a list of perhaps fifty to one hundred or so Nazi leaders. Once the list was reviewed by some sort of international committee of jurists, these men would be declared &#x201c;outlaws&#x201d; and thus fair game for anyone who wished to kill them. For Churchill, if there was to be anything like a trial for the major war criminals, its job would be to verify the identity of these &#x201c;outlaws.&#x201d;<br><br> One of the most remarkable exchanges on the topic of summary executions took place at a Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin meeting during the Tehran Conference (November 28&#x2013;December 1, 1943). Over dinner on November 29, Stalin suggested in passing that if at the end of the war about fifty thousand leaders of the German armed forces were rounded up and liquidated, then Germany&#x2019;s military might would be ended once and for all. Churchill was taken aback by the scale of the liquidations envisioned by Stalin. He said simply that the British Parliament and public would never accept such mass executions. But Roosevelt responded to Stalin more warmly, and when Churchill became upset (or so Churchill recalled), FDR said that the Allies should execute not fifty thousand, but &#x201c;only 49,000.&#x201d; Elliott Roosevelt, the president&#x2019;s son, who happened to be present, chimed in to say he was sure the United States Army &#x201c;would support it.&#x201d;<br><br> The drift of this conversation bothered Churchill so much that he left the room, but he was chased down by a jovial Stalin, who said that he was, of course, only joking. If we look at the evidence of later discussions, however, and consider that Stalin had already instigated the liquidation of thousands of his own people and even many in the Soviet officer corps, there is reason to believe that had Churchill been in agreement that evening, an important decision might have been taken. Whether this step would have culminated in a large number of executions remains open to speculation and debate. Certainly, Churchill had his doubts that Stalin and Roosevelt were just pulling his leg on the evening in Tehran. Although he let himself be persuaded by Stalin to return to dinner, he was not &#x201c;fully convinced that all was chaff and there was no serious intent lurking behind.&#x201d;<br><br> Inside the government of the United States there was deep division about what should be done about Nazi war crimes. One of the most powerful voices in favor of executions over a trial of any kind was articulated on September 5, 1944, when Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr. proposed a plan that would have permanently crippled Germany. In the context of that plan he wanted Nazi leaders summarily executed, and on a scale that looked closer to what Stalin had mentioned at Tehran, and not the more &#x201c;modest&#x201d; one that Churchill had in mind. U.S. secretary of war Henry L. Stimson, fortunately, offered a voice of reason on the American side.<br><br> The seventy-six-year-old Stimson would not accept the notion that Germany&#x2019;s economy should be deindustrialized or destroyed, supposedly in order to save the world from another war, and he was also completely opposed to Morgenthau&#x2019;s approach to war criminals. Stimson insisted, to the contrary, on the need for due process, which had to embody &#x201c;the rudimentary aspects of the Bill of Rights.&#x201d; In a memorandum of September 9, 1944, he sagely noted that it was not a matter of being hard or soft on Germany, but of adopting an appropriate method for dealing with the Nazi criminals. The approach had to be a product of &#x201c;careful thought and well-defined procedure.&#x201d; He believed the United States should participate in some kind of international tribunal, one that would charge the main Nazi officials with offenses against &#x201c;the laws of the Rules of War in that they committed wanton and unnecessary cruelties in connection with the prosecution of the war.&#x201d; He noted that these rules had been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court and ought to be &#x201c;the basis of judicial action against the Nazis.&#x201d;<br><br> Roosevelt, however, much to Stimson&#x2019;s consternation, continued to side with Morgenthau&#x2014;who was also a personal friend&#x2014;and the position of summary execution, without trial, by the military. Indeed, in the wake of the Quebec Conference (August 11&#x2013;24, 1944), Roosevelt and Churchill issued a statement that said a judicial process was inappropriate for &#x201c;arch-criminals such as Hitler, Himmler, Goering, and Goebbels.&#x201d; As they put it, &#x201c;Apart from the formidable difficulties of constituting the Court, formulating the charge, and assembling the evidence, the question of [the Nazi leaders&#x2019;] fate is a political and not a judicial one. It could not rest with judges however eminent or learned to decide finally a matter like this, which is of the widest and most vital public policy. This decision must be &#x2018;the joint decision of the Governments of the Allies.&#x2019; This in fact was expressed in the Moscow dec-laration.&#x201d;<br><br> Roosevelt and Churchill came to the conclusion that on balance it would be best to execute certain Nazi leaders without any trials, and this was a point of view that Stalin also seemed to share. Churchill was somewhat surprised, therefore, to learn on a visit to Moscow in October1944 that evidently Stalin had changed his mind. He and other Soviet leaders now favored a trial, along the lines of an international tribunal as originally suggested by Molotov. It is also possible that once Stalin saw for himself that Churchill would never go along with the liquidation of tens of thousands of the German elite, he went over to the idea of holding a trial of the major war criminals, which could be used for propaganda purposes. Perhaps Stalin also thought that in advocating trials, he might be able to polish his tarnished image in the West.<br><br> In the meantime the Soviets were taking steps of their own to settle scores with the invaders. As they liberated their land from the Nazi yoke in the summer of 1943, they began carrying out their own trials, including trials of their own citizens, for participation in Nazi war crimes. In the first such trial (July 14&#x2013;17, 1943), at Krasnodar, the Soviets made public to the world one of the first cases of mass murder of the Jews. There were eight death sentences, which were carried out in the city square in front of a crowd estimated at thirty thousand people. In August and September some smaller Soviet trials followed, but in Kharkov on December 15&#x2013;18, another large and public trial took place, with a similar result. It culminated in the hanging of those found guilty, in the market square before an estimated fifty thousand. The event was widely publicized by special news films as well as on the radio and in the press. Such proceedings reminded some western observers, as well they might, of the show trials that were a prominent feature of the Soviet Great Terror in the late 1930s. The Soviets used these first trials of Nazi sympathizers to appeal to world opinion as well as to strengthen morale. Soviet practice, therefore, began to favor some kind of trial over summary execution. The Soviets&#x2019; intention, of course, was to use the format of a trial to demonstrate the guilt of the accused.<br><br> The governments of the United States and Great Britain were concerned about these Soviet show trials just behind the lines. They were especially worried lest the proceedings set off Nazi retaliations and lead to the execution of American and British prisoners of war who were in German captivity. Indeed, Hitler was incensed, and in response he ordered his own show trials, not of Soviet prisoners of war but of what he called &#x201c;English-American war criminals&#x201d; and especially &#x201c;Anglo-Saxon terror bombers.&#x201d; Hitler&#x2019;s orders were in fact followed up, but eventually came to nothing, as often happened to many of his more destructive orders by war&#x2019;s end.<br><br> The U.S. government, prodded by Stimson, gradually came to accept the view that judicial proceedings were preferable to summary executions. Stimson could not simply voice his opposition to Morgenthau, who seemed to have the support of President Roosevelt; he had to come up with an alternative. In September 1944 he gave the task of looking into such a plan to his assistant secretary John J. McCloy, who passed it down the chain of command. Eventually Colonel Murray C. Bernays produced what turned out to be a key document in the evolution of American policy.<br><br> Bernays was a lawyer in civilian life. He drew up a paper on what he called the &#x201c;trial of European war criminals,&#x201d; in which he made strong arguments in favor of due process. He claimed that a trial would have enormous advantages over mere political condemnation&#x2014;such as had followed the end of the previous war. Bernays argued that the Nazis could and should be charged with conspiracy to commit crime. Moreover, he maintained that certain organizations (such as the Nazi Party, the Gestapo, and the SS) could be indicted, not just a few individual leaders. Such organizations would also be charged with being part of a criminal conspiracy. It would not be necessary to charge every single person in the organization, just &#x201c;representative individuals.&#x201d; Once the organization was tried and convicted, an individual member could be judged as a criminal coconspirator, and given a summary trial by the Allies. It is important to note, however, that contrary to what some of the defendants said when they spoke with Goldensohn, Article 10 of what became the charter of the International Military Tribunal did not simply declare certain Nazi organizations to be criminal. That decision was left to the tribunal to determine. Moreover, any particular member of those organizations that the tribunal eventually found to be criminal was not automatically deemed to be criminal. Each had the right to a trial.<br><br> The political and judicial position of the American administration in favor of trials, along with the conspiracy/organizations approach, was endorsed by Secretary of State Cordell Hull, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, and Stimson. On November 11, 1944, they sent a memorandum to President Roosevelt with a view to providing him with guidance for the upcoming Yalta Conference.<br><br> Roosevelt was surprisingly slow to come around, however. At Yalta (February 7&#x2013;12, 1945), the president apparently made no mention of the changed position of his administration. He and Churchill still seemed to prefer summary executions, but no decisions were taken.<br><br> It was Stalin and the Soviets who perhaps ultimately did most to persuade the other Allies that some sort of &#x201c;judicial procedure was the way forward.&#x201d; Stimson and others kept trying to move the president in that direction. They continued to insist on the need to avoid the impression that the Allies were seeking vengeance. That view was accepted by the new president, Harry S. Truman, after he took over when Roosevelt died suddenly on April 12, 1945.</p><h2>The Tears of My Soul</h2><p>A North Korean spy, trained and indoctrinated by her government to kill ruthlessly and efficiently, offers insight into the rigors of her enforced service, which ended with a conviction for a plane bombing</p><p>Flagellatory mea culpa from a reformed North Korean terrorist who, in 1987, blew up a South Korean airliner, killing all 115 aboard. By Kim Hyun Hee's account, North Korea may be the cruelest nation on earth, but not much is known about it in the West--and so the 31-year-old author's depiction of life there, and of her stern upbringing under the rule of ``Our Great Leader,'' Kim Il Sung, is both revelatory and shocking (``It is North Korean law that anyone who insults the Kim family is punished by being bludgeoned to death with an iron bar''). Distinguished by her high grades, Kim Hyun Hee was tapped at 19 to train as a spy. Her description of the grueling training regimen, and of her final exam--which included a nighttime infiltration of a mock foreign embassy built in nearby woods--forms the suspenseful highlight of her tale. It's almost matched by her account of her sole mission--the Mideast bombing of the airplane, an act aimed at scaring away the 1988 Olympics from its probable South Korean venue--and of her almost instant capture, during which she tried to kill herself by chomping down on a cyanide-laced Marlboro. The rest of her story isn't so compelling, with the narrative gauzed over by guilt as the author details her extradition to South Korea, where she was convicted of murder but pardoned on grounds that she, too, was Communism's victim; her conversion to capitalism as she witnessed the wealth and freedom of Seoul; and her longings for her parents. Presumably a big seller in Korea and Japan, but Kim Hyun Hee's dramatic yet self-absorbed memoir isn't likely to find a large audience here--though American readers will be glad to know that the author's proceeds are earmarked for the families of her bombing victims. (Twenty b&amp;w photographs--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>On November 29, 1987, two North Koreans were arrested in Bahrain, suspected of the terrorist bombing of Korean Air Flight 858 in which 115 people died. One of the suspects committed suicide on the spot; the other, the author of this memoir, swallowed poison but survived. Extradited to Seoul, Hyun Hee confessed, was tried, convicted and sentenced to death. The court later granted a full pardon, ruling that she was not the true culprit in the bombing but an innocent victim of North Korean indoctrination. Here Hyun Hee reveals how she was recruited and trained, and provides details of the bombing. Her depiction of North Korea's Orwellian society is convincing and vivid: it is a world where children patrol the streets and report the slightest ideological infraction and where a citizen speaking disrespectfully of "Beloved Leader" Kim Il Sung can be summarily bludgeoned to death. Also affecting are Hyun Hee's comments about the culture shock she experienced in Seoul and her search for redemption through Christianity. This is a chilling account of brainwashing and subsequent deprogramming.

This time the cruelties and casualties will be even greater, thanks to more advanced technologies. . The next mass atrocities will face less resistance, and generate fewer "rescuers," because the West is even less hobbled by religious scruples about killing the innocent than it was in 1939. . The twenty-first century will be remembered not for Twitter, iTunes, expanding democracy, and the final dismantling of prejudice - but for total warfare, biological weapons, and the virtual disappearance of human rights as a concept.<br> That might be the ugly future, warn the authors of The Race to Save Our Century, unless modern man wakes up and recommits to fundamental moral truths that safeguard human rights and the common good.<br> In The Race to Save Our Century, human rights activist Jason Jones and political/economic scholar John Zmirak, combine to issue a stark warning to the West, and to call on readers to embrace and promote five core principles of a Culture of Life: . The innate dignity of every human person, regardless of race, age, or handicap. . The existence of a transcendent moral order, by which we judge the justice of all laws and policies. The need for a humane economy that embraces freedom in a context of social responsibility. . The crucial importance of decentralized, responsive government that preserves civil society and freedom. . The need for solidarity, for a sense of fellow feeling and common obligation toward each and every member of the human race.</p><p><b>Jason Scott Jones</b> is a filmmaker and human rights activist.

That may be what he says, but he's willing to risk almost everything for one last shot.</p><p>With the law and mobsters on the lookout and five million dollars on the line, it isn't long before Crissa and Benny find themselves on a collision course that neither of them can avoid. This hard-boiled world, where the stakes---and the risks---are always high, unfolds at breakneck speed in <i>Kings of Midnight, </i>another dark and thrilling masterwork of crime fiction from Wallace Stroby.</p></p><p><p>WALLACE STROBY is an award-winning journalist and a former editor at <i>The Star-Ledger</i> in Newark, New Jersey. <i>Kings of Midnight</i> is his fifth novel, following the acclaimed <i>Cold Shot to the Heart</i> and the Barry Award finalist <i>The Barbed-Wire Kiss</i>. He lives in New Jersey.</p><p><b>ONE</b><br><br>Crissa pulled the ski mask over her face, shifted the front-end loader into neutral, looked across the blacktop at the ATM, the redbrick bank beyond. Heat lightning pulsed on the horizon.<br><br>The loader chugged and shook around her, the vibration coming up through her boots. With a gloved hand, she cleared condensation from the windscreen. At the far edge of the parking lot, near the trees, Hollis flashed the headlights of the stolen pickup.<br><br>She worked the bucket control lever with her right hand, heard the mechanism clank and hum. The bucket rose slowly. She&#x2019;d stolen the loader from a construction site a half mile away, driven it here down back roads with the headlights off. They&#x2019;d chosen the bank because of its location. Woods on three sides, and a highway in front. But at 3:00 A.M., the cars were few and moving fast.<br><br>She braked, pushed the steering column lever into first gear, stepped on the throttle pedal. The loader surged forward, eager. She tried to steer around a curb, but caught the edge, the big tires rolling over it, the cabin rising and falling.<br><br>The ATM was on a concrete island, the farthest of the three drive-through lanes. She came in at the wrong angle, had to brake, back up. The reverse sensor beeped, barely audible over the engine. As she backed and filled, she could see Hollis watching her through the windshield of the pickup, getting nervous.<br><br>She ran it in again, this time got the bucket lined up with the ATM, braked. On the screen, she could see flashing advertisements, one fading into another, the screen never dark. She raised the bucket so the bottom edge cleared the concrete island. If she misjudged, smashed the ATM rather than toppled it, she could back up, try again, but that would take more time, more exposure.<br><br>She was in range of the security cameras now, the point of no return. Her hands were clammy inside the gloves. Hollis started to ease the pickup forward, waiting for her. She let her breath out slowly, engaged the bucket safety to lock it into place, and hit the throttle.<br><br>The loader shuddered as the bucket&#x2019;s edge met the base of the ATM, punching into plastic and metal. The ATM groaned, tilted forward into the bucket. The screen blinked out. An alarm began to sound within the bank.<br><br>She braked, worked the bucket control. With a screech and grind, the ATM began to come away from its base. It tilted farther into the bucket, then hung there, still bound to the island with cables and framework.<br><br>Hollis was out of the pickup now, ski mask on, pry bar in hand. Crissa raised the bucket half a foot higher, sparks hissing from the shattered base. This was the risky part. If the ATM broke loose before it was fully in the bucket, it would topple back and away. It would take too much time to right it again. They would have to leave it.<br><br>She shifted into neutral, hauled on the emergency brake. Hollis had his bar wedged into the base of the ATM, working it back and forth. The machine tilted another few inches, enough for him to walk up its back face, and bear down with his weight. He jumped down then, backed away. She raised the bucket again. Resistance at first, metal screaming, and then the ATM came out of the ground all at once, trailing wires and broken masonry, crashing deep into the bucket. She heard glass pop and break.<br><br>Hollis ran back to the pickup and threw the pry bar into the bed. She backed away from the island, the beeper sounding. Bits of plastic and glass littered the blacktop. Ten feet back, she stopped, braked.<br><br>Hollis drove the pickup in front of the loader. It was a big Dodge Ram with heavy-duty suspension and an oversized bed. In this part of South Carolina, it had been easy to find. He&#x2019;d stolen it from the driveway of a darkened house only an hour ago.<br><br>He got out of the pickup to direct her, waving her to adjust in one direction, then the other. When he gave her the thumbs-up and stood back, she uncurled the bucket. The ATM crashed onto its back in the truck bed, the Dodge rocking on its springs. She reversed again, watching the rearview to make sure she cleared the curb. She backed toward the trees to the spot she&#x2019;d picked, where the loader couldn&#x2019;t be seen from the highway, then killed the engine. She pocketed the square ignition key. It was a universal fit for all John Deere loaders. This was the sixth time she had used it.<br><br>She opened the door, climbed down into the heat. Hollis had pulled the tarp down over the ATM, and was back behind the wheel of the pickup. She walked quickly to the truck, looked up into the glassy eyes of the two cameras mounted on the bank wall, then got in on the passenger side. In the distance, she could hear sirens.<br><br>They pulled away, the truck sluggish from the weight, the shocks squealing. He drove the wrong way out the entrance, bumped onto the highway.<br><br>&#x201c;That one came up easier than the others,&#x201d; she said. She took off her mask, shoved it into a pocket of her windbreaker. Her face was damp with perspiration.<br><br>&#x201c;Could have fooled me.&#x201d; He was watching the rearview for lights. The sirens grew louder.<br><br>&#x201c;Mask,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, shit.&#x201d;<br><br>She reached over to steady the wheel while he pulled off his mask.<br><br>&#x201c;Up here,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;On the right.&#x201d; They&#x2019;d rehearsed the route, but it was easy to miss the turn in the dark. He steered onto a side road that led into woods.<br><br>&#x201c;You can turn on the lights now,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And slow down.&#x201d;<br><br>He popped the headlights on, eased off the gas. His dark face glistened with sweat.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget that mask when we&#x2019;re done,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;DNA.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; The windshield was fogging now. He leaned over the steering wheel, and wiped at the glass with a gloved hand.<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to do that,&#x201d; she said. She fiddled with the dashboard controls, turned on the defroster. The fan hummed, and the glass began to clear. In the harsh light of the headlamps, the trees on both sides of the road seemed to be reaching toward them.<br><br>&#x201c;This thing&#x2019;s built for heavy loads,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Handles good even with all this weight. Maybe we should keep it, use it next time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No way.&#x201d; They&#x2019;d stolen a different pickup each time, abandoned it when they were done. &#x201c;Last thing you want is to be driving around in a hot truck.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We can switch out the plates.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Forget it. Besides, there isn&#x2019;t going to be a next time. Not for me.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked at her. &#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve done this six times now, each time the same way. How long before they start staking out construction sites close to banks? Or disabling front-end loaders?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But we&#x2019;ve moved around. Three different states&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only a matter of time. It was a good gig, but we played it out. Time to walk away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hate to hear you say that.&#x201d;<br><br>They were on a hill now. The ATM slid in the bed, thumped one of the walls. He shifted into low gear. She heard the far-off rumble of thunder.<br><br>&#x201c;You and Rorey want to keep working it, I&#x2019;ll teach you how to run a loader,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not hard, and you&#x2019;ve got the key. But my advice is to move on. We&#x2019;ve all made enough from this anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Rorey,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Only reason I&#x2019;m working with that cracker is because of you.&#x201d;<br><br>She&#x2019;d brought Rorey in, on the word of a contact she had in Georgia. It was Hollis&#x2019;s gig, but the two men he&#x2019;d been using&#x2014;one a laid-off heavy equipment operator&#x2014;had both landed long bids on drug charges. Hollis had found the man in Georgia, who found Crissa. She&#x2019;d come on board, and helped Hollis fine-tune the plan to only hit machines on Friday and Saturday nights when they were loaded for the weekend. She&#x2019;d brought Rorey in as the third man, but there had been friction between the two from the start.<br><br>&#x201c;Dump him,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Find someone else. Rorey&#x2019;s an adult, he&#x2019;ll get over it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When he starts talking that good ol&#x2019; boy bullshit, I like to bend that crowbar over his head. No way I&#x2019;d work with him without you there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then there&#x2019;s your answer.&#x201d; She looked out the window at woods passing by. The road had leveled off now, and soon she could see darkened farmhouses, fields, grain silos.<br><br>&#x201c;Not too fast,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll miss it.&#x201d;<br><br>She unzipped a windbreaker pocket, took out the disposable cell phone, powered it up. She dialed Rorey, and waited. When he answered, she said, &#x201c;How&#x2019;s it look?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good to go. Everything quiet. You?&#x201d; If something had gone wrong on either end, their code word was &#x201c;zero.&#x201d; It meant things had fallen apart, one way or another, to split up and keep going.<br><br>&#x201c;All good,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re close.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave the light on. See you in a few.&#x201d; He ended the call.<br><br>&#x201c;So, what are you going to do next?&#x201d; Hollis said.<br><br>&#x201c;Like I said in the beginning, I was just down here to build up the nest egg. I need to head back north.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nice nest egg.&#x201d;<br><br>Each of the ATMs they&#x2019;d hit had carried from $30,000 to $150,000 in tens and twenties. When Hollis had first told her about the work, she&#x2019;d doubted him. The numbers sounded too high. But they&#x2019;d taken $125,000 from the first machine; $80,000 from the second. At her hotel back in Columbia was a pair of suitcases containing $175,000, her split of what they&#x2019;d taken so far.<br><br>&#x201c;It worked out,&#x336;...</p></p><h2>Sons of Fenris (Warhammer 40,000: Space Wolf)</h2><p>Ragnar and the Wolfblade are sent to investigate reports of Chaos attacks on the planet Hyades.

From this springboard&#x2015;which Bolano chose to publish in 2002, twenty years after he&#x2019;d written it (&#x201c;and even that I can&#x2019;t be certain of&#x201d;)&#x2015;as if testing out a high dive, he would plunge into the unexplored depths of the modern novel.<br><br> Antwerp&#x2019;s fractured narration in 54 sections&#x2015;voices from a dream, from a nightmare, from passers by, from an omniscient narrator, from &#x201c;Roberto Bolano&#x201d; all speak&#x2015;moves in multiple directions and cuts to the bone.</p><p><p>Author of <em>2666</em> and many other acclaimed works, <strong>Roberto Bolano</strong> (1953-2003) was born in Santiago, Chile, and later lived in Mexico, Paris, and Spain. He has been acclaimed &#x201c;by far the most exciting writer to come from south of the Rio Grande in a long time&#x201d; (Ilan Stavans, <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>),&#x201d; and as &#x201c;the real thing and the rarest&#x201d; (Susan Sontag). Among his many prizes are the extremely prestigious Herralde de Novela Award and the Premio R�mulo Gallegos. He was widely considered to be the greatest Latin American writer of his generation. He wrote nine novels, two story collections, and five books of poetry, before dying in July 2003 at the age of 50.</p><p><strong>Natasha Wimmer</strong>&#x2019;s translation of Roberto Bolano&#x2019;s <em>2666</em> won the National Book Award&#x2019;s Best Novel of the Year as well as the PEN Prize.</p>The dead and wildly fashionable Bola�o (<i>2666</i>) seems doomed to have all of his scribblings published. Hence this slapdash collation of 56 cinematic gestures set in 1980 Barcelona and featuring a nervous South American narrator named Roberto Bola�o, who is fascinated by facade versus reality, observes himself as if from the outside, and records random scenes (i.e., a hunchback eating sardines from a can in the woods). Alternately, elements of a detective plot are set up but hardly developed and involve a police sergeant searching for someone (perhaps the hunchback) and a nameless young woman (red-haired, a drug addict, a witness) sodomized by a cop&#x2014;or is it the narrator? Bola�o derides conventional story lines (rules about plot only apply to novels that are copies of other novels) in favor of recording senseless, disjointed snippets of speech, errant impressions, and sensations. Collectively, these might be viewed as the paranoid, manic musings of a writer desperately searching for material. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In the conference rooms of a luxury hotel, as war rages outside, he listens to a series of extraordinary life stories: the saga of a chess-playing duo, the tale of an Italian porn star with a socialist agenda, the drama of a Colombian industrialist who has been waging a longstanding battle with local paramilitaries, and many more. But it is Jos� Maturana&#x2014;evangelical pastor, recovering drug addict, ex-con&#x2014;with his story of redemption at the hands of a charismatic tattooed messiah from Miami, Florida, who fascinates the author more than any other. Maturana's language is potent and vital, and his story captivating.&nbsp;<br><br>Hours after his stirring presentation to a rapt audience, however, Maturana is found dead in his hotel room. At first it seems likely that Maturana has taken his own life. But there are a few loose ends that don't support the suicide hypothesis, and the author-invitee, moved by Maturana's life story to discover the truth about his death, will lead a search that drives the entire plot of this chimerical novel beyond the action-filled investigation and to a thought that resonates universally.&nbsp;<br><br><b>WINNER OF THE 2009 LA OTRA ORILLA LITERARY AWARD</b></p></p><p>Novelist, short story writer, and journalist,&nbsp;<b>Santiago Gamboa</b>&nbsp;was born in Colombia in 1965.

In producing this CD-ROM, the compilers discovered that there was no book that gave the life histories of birds in general. To remedy this, Kaufman expanded the descriptions of birds' lives that he developed for the <i>Multimedia Guides </i>to produce this beautifully organized book for the layperson. As he states in his acknowledgements, "Although there have been many multimedia products based on books, probably few books besides this one have started off in CD-ROM form."<p>Bird-watchers have relied on the <i>Peterson Guides </i>over the years to identify birds, giving names, habitat, descriptions, and distribution information. However, no guide has gone that additional step to describe what the bird is doing at the time it is being observed. Many scientific articles about birds do describe "what they are doing" in technical terms. Kaufman has translated all this information into layperson's language.</p><p>The book is organized so that when a particular page is consulted, it is easy to understand without referrring to other parts of the book. Each family has a brief overview that describes the bird and its feeding, nesting, and displaying characteristics. Additional information is given for the genus, followed by detailed facts about each species. This information includes a full-color photograph; a distribution map; habitat, feeding, nesting, and migration data; and conservation status, all in a concise, easy-to-read text. Illustrations, which were taken from the CD-ROM, are clear but small, with only one per species. Of particular interest is information on certain behavior and movement characteristics, which includes how food is acquired, how young are fed, mating rituals, what the young look like and how soon they leave the nest, and how they interact with other species in the competition for food and nesting sites. Additionally, there may be information on specific species about territory claiming, social aspects, songs and calls, pairing, courtship, eggs, clutch size, incubation, number of broods per year, what they eat, how they find food, molting, roosting, and life span.</p><p>Part of the Peterson Natural History Companion series, this is a must-have book to supplement any field guide. It could be used as a general field guide, although it is too big to fit into a coat pocket. It is a good alternative to field guides in a reference collection because it provides expanded information in a convenient, attractive format. Recommended for all bird-watchers and all libraries. <i></i></p></p><h2>At Home Caf�: Gatherings for Family and Friends</h2><p>With the publication of her first <i>At Home Cafe&#x301; </i>cookbook, Helen Puckett DeFrance took her message of family bonding through cooking into homes all across America. Their tried and-true recipes, an inspired mix of old and new traditions, highlighted the pleasures of casual, at-home get-togethers with family and friends. <br> Now DeFrance is back with an all new <i>At Home Cafe&#x301;</i> cookbook, and once again casual entertaining takes center stage. Building on how the first book involved the whole family in the kitchen, this new volume features entertaining with friends and neighbors, including <i>Neighbor Notes</i> on complementary dishes that guests can bring. A wealth of menus is offered for spontaneous occasions as well, from the unstructured fun of a neighborhood picnic (featuring Buttermilk Fried Chicken Tenders and Po-Boy Sandwiches) to the relaxing weekend pleasure of a Southern jazz brunch (with Crab and Artichoke Casserole, Cheddar Cheese Puffs with Apple Smoked Bacon, and Creamy Dreamy Berry Treats). A countdown for every menu makes planning a breeze.<br> The author is a veteran cooking school teacher with a knack for keeping things simple. Whether it is a hearty soup served around the fireplace on a cold winter's night; a make ahead casserole for those evenings when there's no time to cook; or a low-key tree-trimming get-together during the high-stress holidays, a whole lot of comfort is served up in these delectable dishes designed to create special memories with loved ones.</p><p><b>HELEN PUCKETT DEFRANCE </b>conducts regular classes and demonstrations at cooking schools throughout the Southeast and has appeared on Martha Stewart's show. She lives in Jackson, Mississippi.In this follow-up to her first book, <i>At Home Cafe</i>, DeFrance encourages home chefs to make cooking "not a chore, but an opportunity to spend time with friends and family" and provides a slate of menus suitable for a variety of occasions. Culinary themes include Deep South Brunch, Teen Taco Bar, and Shrimp under the Oak Trees. DeFrance is a seasoned cooking teacher--the Camp Blackberry cooking program in Knoxville, Tenn., and Viking Cooking Schools nationwide are in her regular rotation. In various "Helping Hands" sidebars, she makes suggestions for both seasoned cooks ("Peeling shrimp... requires some skill") and kids ("Pulling yellow or damaged leaves off Brussels sprouts is a task for little hands"). Recipes range from familiar favorites like Warm Crab Dip and Lemon Squares to more creative fare, such as Cognac-Scented Chicken Liver P�te. Writing with her sister Carol Puckett, DeFrance has a friendly, warm voice, offering personal anecdotes and enthusiastic commentary about the recipes.

With its rich, roasted-peanut aroma and flavor; caramel hue; and gooey, consoling texture, peanut butter is an enduring favorite, found in the pantries of at least 75 percent of American kitchens. Americans eat more than a billion pounds a year. According to the Southern Peanut Growers, a trade group, that's enough to coat the floor of the Grand Canyon (although the association doesn't say to what height).<br><br>Americans spoon it out of the jar, eat it in sandwiches by itself or with its bread-fellow jelly, and devour it with foods ranging from celery and raisins ("ants on a log") to a grilled sandwich with bacon and bananas (the classic "Elvis"). Peanut butter is used to flavor candy, ice cream, cookies, cereal, and other foods. It is a deeply ingrained staple of American childhood. Along with cheeseburgers, fried chicken, chocolate chip cookies (and apple pie), peanut butter is a consummate comfort food. <br><br>In <i>Creamy and Crunchy</i> are the stories of Jif, Skippy, Peter Pan; the plight of black peanut farmers; the resurgence of natural or old-fashioned peanut butter; the reasons why Americans like peanut butter better than (almost) anyone else; the five ways that today's product is different from the original; the role of peanut butter in fighting Third World hunger; and the Salmonella outbreaks of 2007 and 2009, which threatened peanut butter's sacred place in the American cupboard. To a surprising extent, the story of peanut butter is the story of twentieth-century America, and Jon Krampner writes its first popular history, rich with anecdotes and facts culled from interviews, research, travels in the peanut-growing regions of the South, personal stories, and recipes.</p><p>Americans spoon it out of the jar, eat it in sandwiches by itself or with its bread-fellow jelly, and devour it with foods ranging from celery and raisins ("ants on a log") to a grilled sandwich with bacon and bananas (the classic "Elvis").

Play with Your Food shows you how to look at something ordinary and turn it into something magical. No special tools or techniques are needed, just you -- and your child&#39;s -- imagination.</p><p>You <i>can</i> play with your food. In fact, you should. All the details are in Joost Elffert's remarkable <i>Play with Your Food</i>, which introduces readers to a new way of seeing the food they eat, then shows them how to transform that food into creatures of extraordinary personality.<p> Put a navel orange on its side, pip facing you. See anything yet? What do the folds suggest? Carve ovals and insert beans and sliced almonds--voila, two eyes. Cut ears from the sides of the orange and pull them forward. Now you have it--a cat's face of amazing and endearing character. But that's only the beginning. Learn to make artichoke-leaf aphids, bok choy buffalos, okra grasshoppers, green-pepper camels, and pear mice--just a few of the 75 ingenious projects.</p><p> Consisting primarily of color photos of the creatures, first in portraiture and then in step-by-step "recipes" for their creation, <i>Play with Your Food</i> teaches readers above all to see. In addition to limning techniques, the minimal text provides a short look at manmade and natural imagery that suggests or embodies the possibilities of metamorphosis. Then it's on to the creatures themselves and the fun of constructing them. Anyone who enjoys play and the magic of transformation will want Joost's book--and having seen it, will never look at eatables in the same way again. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>In September 1997, Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang published the incredibly successful <i>Play with Your Food</i>, which currently has over 175,000 copies in print.

This time the presiding tutelary geniuses are Jonathan Edwards and Wallace Stevens.<br></strong></p><p><em>Souls of the Labadie</em> Tract finds Susan Howe exploring (or unsettling) one of her favorite domains, the psychic past of America, with Jonathan Edwards and Wallace Stevens as her presiding tutelary geniuses. Three long poems interspersed with prose pieces, <em>Souls of the Labadie Tract</em> takes as its starting point the Labadists, a Utopian Quietest sect that moved from the Netherlands to Cecil County, Maryland, in 1684. The community dissolved in 1722. In <em>Souls</em>, Howe is lured by archives and libraries, with their ghosts, cranks, manuscripts and scraps of material. One thread winding through Souls is silken: from the epigraphs of Edwards ("the silkworm is a remarkable type of Christ...") and of Stevens ("the poet makes silk dresses out of worms") to the mulberry tree (food of the silkworms) and the fragment of a wedding dress that ends the book. <em>Souls of the Labadie Tract</em> presents Howe with her signature hybrids of poetry and prose, of evocation and refraction:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There it is there it is&#x2015;you<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want the great wicked city<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh I wouldn't I wouldn't<br></p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not only that you're not<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's what wills and will not.</p><p>Susan Howe has won the Bollingen Prize, the Frost Medal, and the Griffin Award. She is the author of such seminal works as Debths, That This, The Midnight, My Emily Dickinson, The Quarry, and The Birthmark.Starred Review. Over the past three decades Howe has worked as a kind of poet-scholar manqu�, mixing into her books prose explorations of early American spiritual and historical chroniclers and her own distinctive poems, usually terse, four-stress snippets that themselves seem like fugitive fragments from a larger suppressed text. In her newest book, Howe stands in thrall to a 17th-century history of Deerfield, Mass., and then chases down an obscure reference to Labadist in Wallace Stevens's family tree, which brings her to the story of a short-lived Utopian quietest sect, followers of Jean de Labadie who established a community in Maryland in 1684 that vanished within 40 years. It is in these vast tracts of time made intimate by texts, by language, that Howe operates: I keep you here to keep/ your promise all that you/ think I've wrought what// I see or do in the twilight/ of time but keep forgetting/ you keep coming back. Beginning with a quote from Jonathan Edwards equating the silkworm to a type of Christ and ending with a photograph of a fragment of the silk wedding dress of Edwards's wife, onto which Howe projects a text (I have already shown that space is God), this is intense stuff. Published simultaneously with a new edition (prefaced by Eliot Weinberger) of Howe's classic critical work <i>My Emily Dickinson</i>. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Far from distorting the truth about Jesus of Nazareth, insists Pope Benedict, the early disciples remained faithful to it, even at the cost of their lives. <p> Beginning with the Twelve as the foundation of Jesus' re-establishment of the Holy People of God, Pope Benedict examines the story of the early followers of Christ. He draws on Scripture and early tradition to consider such important figures as Peter, Andrew, James and John, and even Judas Iscariot. Benedict moves beyond the original Twelve to discuss Paul of Tarsus, the persecutor of Christianity who became one of Jesus' greatest disciples. Also considered are Stephen, the first Christian martyr, Barnabas, Timothy, Titus, the wife and husband "team" of Priscilla and Aquila, and such key women figures as Mary, the Mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Phoebe.</p><p> <i>Jesus, the Apostles and the Early Church</i> is a fascinating journey back to the origins of Christianity. It reveals how Jesus' earliest disciples faithfully conveyed the truth about the "Jesus of history" and how they laid the foundations for the Church, through whom people today can know the same Jesus.</p></p><p><p><strong>Pope Benedict XVI (Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger)</strong> is widely recognized as one of the most brilliant theologians and spiritual leaders of our age.

She lives in Pennsylvania with her family.In Thompson's fine 12th mystery set in turn-of-the-20th-century New York City (after 2009's <i>Murder on Waverly Place</i>), Det. Sgt. Frank Malloy investigates the murder of Nehemiah Wooten, who was bludgeoned with a loving cup Wooten won for sculling at Harvard more than 30 years earlier. A follower of Alexander Graham Bell's views on eugenics, Wooten was opposed to two deaf people getting married on the grounds that such unions would produce only deaf offspring, an attitude that earned him an enemy within his own home. Wooten's attractive 16-year-old daughter, Electra, who could not hear, was hoping to marry a deaf teacher. When Malloy visits Wooten's pregnant widow and her water breaks, he calls in midwife Sarah Brandt. Thanks to her access to the victim's household, Sarah proves invaluable in helping him uncover the killer. While the psychology of the crime is less complicated than some might prefer, Thompson does a solid job bringing the past to life. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lourdes feeds her breakfast and thinks of<br>Enrique and Belky. She asks herself: &#x201c;Do my children cry like<br>this? I&#x2019;m giving this girl food instead of feeding my own children.&#x201d;<br>To get the girl to eat, Lourdes pretends the spoon is an<br>airplane. But each time the spoon lands in the girl&#x2019;s mouth,<br>Lourdes is filled with sadness.<br><br>In the afternoon, after the girl comes home from prekindergarten<br>class, they thumb through picture books and play. The<br>girl, so close to Enrique&#x2019;s age, is a constant reminder of her son.<br>Many afternoons, Lourdes cannot contain her grief. She gives<br>the girl a toy and dashes into the kitchen. There, out of sight,<br>tears flow. After seven months, she cannot take it. She quits and<br>moves to a friend&#x2019;s place in Long Beach.<br><br>Boxes arrive in Tegucigalpa bearing clothes, shoes, toy cars,<br>a Robocop doll, a television. Lourdes writes: Do they like the<br>things she is sending? She tells Enrique to behave, to study<br>hard. She has hopes for him: graduation from high school, a<br>white-collar job, maybe as an engineer. She pictures her son<br>working in a crisp shirt and shiny shoes. She says she loves him.<br>Enrique asks about his mother. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be home soon,&#x201d; his<br>grandmother assures him. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. She&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201d;<br><br>But his mother does not come. Her disappearance is incomprehensible.<br>Enrique&#x2019;s bewilderment turns to confusion<br>and then to adolescent anger.<br>When Enrique is seven, his father brings a woman home.<br>To her, Enrique is an economic burden.

But<br>their separation is brief.<br>&#x201c;Mom,&#x201d; Enrique&#x2019;s father tells the grandmother, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t<br>think of anyone but that woman.&#x201d;<br><br>Enrique&#x2019;s father bathes, dresses, splashes on cologne, and<br>follows her. Enrique tags along and begs to stay with him. But<br>his father tells him to go back to his grandmother.<br>His father begins a new family. Enrique sees him rarely,<br>usually by chance. In time, Enrique&#x2019;s love turns to contempt.<br>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t love me. He loves the children he has with his<br>wife,&#x201d; he tells Belky. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a dad.&#x201d;<br><br>His father notices. &#x201c;He looks at me as if he wasn&#x2019;t my son,<br>as if he wants to strangle me,&#x201d; he tells Enrique&#x2019;s grandmother.<br>Most of the blame, his father decides, belongs to Enrique&#x2019;s<br>mother. &#x201c;She is the one who promised to come back.&#x201d;<br>For Belky, their mother&#x2019;s disappearance is just as distressing.<br>She lives with Aunt Rosa Amalia, one of her mother&#x2019;s sisters.<br>On Mother&#x2019;s Day, Belky struggles through a celebration at<br>school.

She reminds herself of all the<br>other things her mother ships south: Reebok tennis shoes, black<br>sandals, the yellow bear and pink puppy stuffed toys on her<br>bed. She commiserates with a friend whose mother has also<br>left. They console each other. They know a girl whose mother<br>died of a heart attack. At least, they say, ours are alive.<br>But Rosa Amalia thinks the separation has caused deep<br>emotional problems. To her, it seems that Belky is struggling<br>with an unavoidable question: How can I be worth anything if<br>my mother left me?<br><br>&#x201c;There are days,&#x201d; Belky tells Aunt Rosa Amalia, &#x201c;when I<br>wake up and feel so alone.&#x201d; Belky is temperamental. Sometimes<br>she stops talking to everyone.

Alone now, he and his father&#x2019;s elderly mother<br>share a shack thirty feet square. Mar�a Marcos built it herself of<br>wooden slats. Enrique can see daylight in the cracks. It has four<br>rooms, three without electricity. There is no running water.<br>Gutters carry rain off the patched tin roof into two barrels. A<br>trickle of cloudy white sewage runs past the front gate. On a<br>well-worn rock nearby, Enrique&#x2019;s grandmother washes musty<br>used clothing she sells door to door. Next to the rock is the latrine&#x2014;<br>a concrete hole. Beside it are buckets for bathing.<br>The shack is in Carrizal, one of Tegucigalpa&#x2019;s poorest<br>neighborhoods. Sometimes Enrique looks across the rolling<br>hills to the neighborhood where he and his mother lived and<br>where Belky still lives with their mother&#x2019;s family. They are six<br>miles apart. They hardly ever visit.<br><br>Lourdes sends Enrique $50 a month, occasionally $100,<br>sometimes nothing. It is enough for food but not for school<br>clothes, fees, notebooks, or pencils, which are expensive in<br>Honduras. There is never enough for a birthday present. But<br>Grandmother Mar�a hugs him and wishes him a cheery <i>�Feliz<br>cumplea�os! </i>&#x201c;Your mom can&#x2019;t send enough,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;so we<br>both have to work.&#x201d;<br><br>Enrique loves to climb his grandmother&#x2019;s guayaba tree, but<br>there is no more time for play now.

Intended by Keckley to rehabilitate the reputation of the former First Lady--who had run up extensive debts on clothing and other luxuries while in the White House, and found herself unable to repay them after the President's assassination--the book was perceived instead as a betrayal of friendship. <p> Perhaps one of the first examples of celebrity gossip publishing gone awry, Behind the Scenes does, nevertheless, offer an insider perspective on the Lincoln White House that will intrigue armchair historians and fans of biography alike.</p>Elizabeth Hobbs Keckley</p><h2>Hinds&#39; Feet on High Places</h2><p><p><em>Hinds&#x2019; Feet on High Places</em>&nbsp;remains Hannah Hurnard&#x2019;s best known and most beloved book: a timeless allegory dramatizing the yearning of God&#x2019;s children to be led to new heights of love, joy, and victory.

Darwin&#39;s analysis of flora and fauna calls into question the long-held concepts of spontaneous generation, divine creation, and the unrelatedness of many species. Instead, he argues for Natural Selection: species survive and evolve in response to environmental conditions and other circumstances through a process in which those creatures and plants with stronger, more enduring characteristics live to beget more adaptable offspring. It was Darwin&#39;s research aboard the H.M.S. Beagle that led to the clash of intellectual titans - religion and science - over the true nature of humankind. Here is the book that started one of the greatest debates of the Western world.</p><p>This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

Arguing for a material, not divine, origin of species, he showed that new species are achieved by &#39;natural selection&#39;. Development, diversification, decay, extinction and absence of plan are all inherent to his theories. Darwin read prodigiously across many fields; he reflected on his experiences as a traveller, he experimented. His profoundly influential concept of &#39;natural selection&#39; condenses materials from past and present, from the Galapagos Islands to rural Staffordshire, from English back gardens to colonial encounters. The Origin communicates the enthusiasm of original thinking in an open, descriptive style, and Darwin&#39;s emphasis on the value of diversity speaks more strongly now than ever.</p><h2>Constant Craving: What Your Food Cravings Mean and How to Overcome Them</h2><p>Describes the psychological feelings behind food cravings, and argues that psychological needs must be met before one can improve one&#39;s eating habits</p><p><p><b>Doreen Virtue</b> is a best-selling author, a doctor of psychology, and a Christian who studies scripture.

The volcanic processes by which the Hawaiian Islands grew from the ocean floor were inconceivably slow, and the land remained untouched by man for countless centuries until, little more than a thousand years ago, Polynesian seafarers made the perilous journey across the Pacific and discovered their new home. They lived and flourished in this tropical paradise according to their ancient traditions and beliefs until, in the early nineteenth century, American missionaries arrived, bringing a new creed and a new way of life to a Stone Age society. The impact of the missionaries had only begun to be absorbed when other national groups, with equally different customs, began to migrate in great numbers to the islands. The story of modern Hawaii, and of this novel, is one of how disparate peoples, struggling to keep their identity yet live with one another in harmony, ultimately joined together to build America&#39;s strong and vital fiftieth state.</p><p>The saga of a land from the time when the volcanic islands rose out of the sea to the decade in which they become the 50th state.

They are offered with great warmth and wisdom by a person who is both an anthropologist and a missionary. . . . With the addition of some questions for further thought and suggestions for reading, this book will make a good textbook in the field of missionary anthropology.??? ???Gottfried Oosterwal, Religious Studies Review ???In this book Paul Hiebert has pulled together an impressive array of insights (from his own missionary experience and from the experience of other missionaries) which anthropology offers the would-be missionary. . . . The book has been written in an easy-to-read, straightforward style. Hiebert provides an abundance of primary sources for those who might want to pursue further individual insights. It is a book that will be valuable to mission executives, missionary candidates, and even experienced missionaries.??? ???Jacob A. Loewen, Missiology ???This is a book that needed to be written. . . . No single volume focuses the insights derived from the study of anthropology so comprehensively and yet so practically on the life and work of the average evangelical missionary as does this one. While ideal as a supplementary text for a course in missionary anthropology, this book can be read with real profit by anyone engaged in or contemplating a cross-cultural ministry. . . . The book is replete with helpful tables, charts, diagrams, and carefully selected excerpts from other writers. . . . This is the kind of book that deserves to be read not only at the beginning of one??&#39;s missionary career, but at five-year intervals thereafter.??? ???Kenneth Mulholland, Evangelical Missions Quarterly ???A masterful tool. . . . [Hiebert] provides a sound treatment both of culture and the Gospel which denies the complexity of neither. He treats the task of living in another culture with much practical wisdom and a good deal of intellectual sophistication. He presents a thoroughly sound and persuasive approach to contextualization and the communication of the Gospel. . . . This is all done in clear, non-jargony language. Effective charts and diagrams sprinkle the text and go a long way towards illustrating difficult concepts and ideas. . . . This book is believable, convincing, and practical. . . . It would be useful for courses in applied anthropology, missiology and missionary preparation, and the theory of culture.??? ???Harley Schreck, Perspectives on Science and Christian FaithThe late<b> Paul G.

Some have branches that have snapped under the weight. I can&#x2019;t recall another year when there were so many plums.<br>&nbsp;<br>When ripe those purple plums acquire a bloom the colour of dusk. At midday if there&#x2019;s sunlight &#x2013; and it has been sunny for days on end &#x2013; you see clusters of them, the colour of dusk, hanging behind the leaves.<br>&nbsp;<br>Blueberries are the only other fruit which are as blue, but their blue is dark and gemlike, whereas the quetsch blue is like a vivid but vanishing blue smoke. The clusters of four, five or six fruit grow like handfuls from small shoots of the trees&#x2019; branches. From a single tree hang hundreds of handfuls.<br>&nbsp;<br>Early one morning I decide to draw a cluster, perhaps to understand better why I repeatedly say &#x2018;handful&#x2019;. The drawing was clumsy and bad. I begin another. Three handfuls away from the one I have chosen to draw, a small black and white snail, small as my fingernail, is asleep on the leaf it has been eating. The second drawing was as bad as the first. So I stopped and began the day&#x2019;s tasks.<br>&nbsp;<br>Towards the end of the afternoon I returned to the plum trees with the idea of trying, one more time, to draw the same cluster. Perhaps due to the change of light &#x2013; the sun was no longer in the east but the west &#x2013; I could not find or identify the cluster. I even asked myself whether I was under the right tree.<br>&nbsp;<br>I moved over to the next tree, stooping under its branches, peering up. There were countless quetsch but not my handful. It would of course have been easy to draw another cluster but something in me obstinately refused. I circled under the branches of both trees again and again. And then I spotted the snail. Thirty centimetres to his left I found my cluster. The snail had changed his position but not his whereabouts. I took a good look at him.<br>&nbsp;<br>I began to draw. I needed a green to mark the leaves. At my feet were some nettles. I picked a leaf, rubbed it on the paper, and it gave me a green. This time I kept the drawing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Three days afterwards it was time to harvest the plums. If put in barrels to ferment for a few months, you can distil an excellent slivovitz from them. They also make good jam and are wonderful on tarts.<br>&nbsp;<br>To harvest quetsch you either shake the tree&#x2019;s boughs and many plums fall to the ground, or you climb up into the tree with a bucket and pick them by hand.<br>&nbsp;<br>The trees have incipient thorns and a multitude of twigs. High in the tree, you have the sensation of crawling through undergrowth, proceeding from one small blue smoke ring to another, and gathering in the palm of your free hand, warm thumb after warm thumb. You can hold three or four, or five, not more. This is why I call the clusters handfuls. Inevitably some of the fruit roll down your wrist and fall to the grass.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I was later on my knees picking up plums from the grass and dropping them into a basket, I came across several black and white snails, who had fallen unhurt to the ground with the fruit. I placed five of them side by side, and to my surprise it was easy for me to recognise the one who had been my guide. I made a drawing of him, a little over life-size.<br>&nbsp;<br>###<br>&nbsp;<br>The philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632&#x2013;1677) &#x2013; generally known as Benedict (or Bento) de Spinoza &#x2013; earnt his living as a lens-grinder and spent the most intense years of his short life writing On the Improvement of the Understanding and the Ethics, both of which were only published posthumously. We know from other peoples&#x2019; souvenirs and memories of the philosopher that he also drew. He enjoyed drawing. He carried a sketchbook around with him. After his sudden death &#x2013; perhaps from silicosis, a consequence of his grinding lenses &#x2013; his friends rescued letters, manuscripts, notes, but apparently didn&#x2019;t find a sketchbook. Or, if they did, it later got lost.<br>&nbsp;<br>For years now, I have imagined a sketchbook with his drawings in it being found. I didn&#x2019;t know what I hoped to find in it. Drawings of what? Drawn in what kind of manner? De Hooch, Vermeer, Jan Steen, Gerard Dou were his contemporaries. For a while in Amsterdam he lived a few hundred metres away from Rembrandt, who was twenty-six years his elder. Biographers suggest the two of them probably met. As a draughtsman Spinoza would have been an amateur. I wasn&#x2019;t expecting great drawings in the sketchbook, were it to be found. I simply wanted to reread some of his words, some of his startling propositions as a philosopher, whilst at the same time being able to look at things he had observed with his own eyes.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then last year a Polish printer, who is a friend of mine living in Bavaria, gave me a virgin sketchbook, covered with suede leather, the colour of skin. And I heard myself saying: This is Bento&#x2019;s!<br>&nbsp;<br>I began to make drawings prompted by something asking to be drawn.<br>&nbsp;<br>As time goes by, however, the two of us &#x2013; Bento and I &#x2013; become less distinct. Within the act of looking, the act of questioning with our eyes, we become somewhat interchangeable. And this happens, I guess, because of a shared awareness about where and to what the practice of drawing can lead.<br>&nbsp;<br>###<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m drawing some irises which are growing against the south wall of a house. They are about one metre tall, but, beginning to be in full bloom, they are somewhat bent over by the weight of their flowers. Four to a stalk. The sun is shining. It&#x2019;s the month of May. All the snow at altitudes less than 1500m has melted.<br>&nbsp;<br>I think these irises are of a variety called Copper Lustre. Their colours are dark crimson-brown, yellow, white, copper: the colours of the instruments of a brass band being played with abandon. Their stalks and calyxes and sepals are a pale viridian.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m drawing with black ink (Sheaffer) and wash and spit, using my finger rather than a brush. Beside me on the grass, where I&#x2019;m sitting, are a few sheets of coloured Chinese rice paper. I chose them for their cereal colours. Maybe later I will tear shapes from them and use them as collage. I have a glue-stick if need be. There&#x2019;s also on the grass a bright yellow oil pastel, taken from a pastel kit made for schoolkids with the trade-name Giotto.<br>&nbsp;<br>The drawn flowers look as though they&#x2019;re going to be half life-size. You lose your sense of time when drawing. You are so concentrated on scales of space. I&#x2019;ve probably been drawing for about forty minutes, perhaps longer.<br>&nbsp;<br>Irises grew in Babylon. Their name came later, from the Greek goddess of the rainbow. The French fleur de lys was an iris. The blossoms occupy the top half of the paper, the stems force their way upwards through the bottom half. The stems are not vertical, they lean to the right.<br>&nbsp;<br>At a certain moment, if you don&#x2019;t decide to abandon a drawing in order to begin another, the looking involved in what you are measuring and summoning up changes.<br>&nbsp;<br>At first you question the model (the seven irises) in order to discover lines, shapes, tones that you can trace on the paper. The drawing accumulates the answers. Also, of course, it accumulates corrections, after further questioning of the first answers. Drawing is correcting. I&#x2019;m beginning now to use the Chinese papers; they turn the ink-lines into veins.<br>&nbsp;<br>At a certain moment &#x2013; if you&#x2019;re lucky &#x2013; the accumulation becomes an image &#x2013; that&#x2019;s to say it stops being a heap of signs and becomes a presence. Uncouth, but a presence. This is when your looking changes. You start questioning the presence as much as the model.<br>&nbsp;<br>How is it asking to be altered so as to become less uncouth? You stare at the drawing and repeatedly glance at the seven irises to look, not at their structure this time, but at what is radiating from them, at their energy. How do they interact with the air around them, with the sunshine, with the warmth reflected off the wall of the house?<br>&nbsp;<br>Drawing now involves subtracting as much as adding. It involves the paper as much as the forms drawn on it. I use razor blade, pencil, yellow crayon, spit. I can&#x2019;t hurry.<br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;m taking my time, as if I had all the time in the world. I do have all the time in the world. And with this belief I continue making the minimal corrections, one after another and then another, in order to make the presence of the seven irises a little more comfortable and so more evident. All the time in the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>In fact I have to deliver the drawing tonight. I have made it for Marie-Claude, who died two days ago, aged fifty-eight, of a heart attack.<br>&nbsp;<br>Tonight the drawing will be in the church somewhere near her coffin. The coffin will be open for those who want to see Marie-Claude for the last time.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her funeral is tomorrow. Then the drawing, rolled up and tied with a ribbon, will be placed with live flowers in her coffin and be buried with her.<br>&nbsp;<br>We who draw do so not only to make something visible to others, but also to accompany something invisible to its incalculable destination.<br>&nbsp;<br>###<br>&nbsp;<br>Two days after Marie-Claude&#x2019;s funeral I received an email telling that a small drawing of mine &#x2013; an eighth of the size of the drawing of the Copper Lustre irises &#x2013; had been sold in a London art auction for �4,500. A sum of money such as Marie-Claude would never have dreamt of having in her hands during her entire lifetime.<br>&nbsp;<br>The auction was organised by the Helen Bamber Foundation, which gives moral, material and legal support to people begging for asylum in Great Britain, people whose lives and identities have been shattered by traffickers of immigrants &#x2013; slave traders in all but name &#x2013; by armies that terrorise civilian populations, and by racist governments. The Foundation appealed to artists to donate a work which could be sold to raise funds for its activities.<br>&nbsp;<br>Along with many others I sent a small contribution: a little portrait in charcoal of the Subcomandante Marcos which I had made in the Chiapas, southeast Mexico, around Christmas 2007.<br>&nbsp;<br>He, I, two Zapatista comandantes and two children are taking it easy in a log cabin on the outskirts of the town of San Crist�bal de Las Casas.<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#x2019;ve written letters to each other, Marcos and I, we&#x2019;ve spoken together from the same platform, but we&#x2019;ve never before sat face to face in private. He knows I&#x2019;d like to draw him. I know he won&#x2019;t take off his mask. We could talk about the forthcoming Mexican elections or about peasants as a class of survivors and we don&#x2019;t. A strange quietude affects us both. We smile. I watch him and I have no sense of urgency about drawing him. It&#x2019;s as if we&#x2019;ve spent countless days together, as if everything is unremarkably familiar and requires no action.<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally I open my sketchbook and pick up a stick of charcoal. I see his low brow, his two eyes, the bridge of his nose. The rest is concealed by ski-mask and cap. I let the charcoal, held between my thumb and two fingers, draw, as if reading by touch some kind of braille. The drawing stops. I blow fixative onto it so it won&#x2019;t smudge. The log cabin smells of the alcohol of the fixative.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the second drawing his right hand comes up to touch the cheek of his mask, a large hand splayed out, with pain between its fingers. The pain of solitude. The solitude of an entire people over the last half millennium.<br>&nbsp;<br>Later a third drawing starts. Two eyes examining me. The presumed undulation of a smile. He is smoking his pipe.<br>&nbsp;<br>Smoking a pipe, or watching a companion smoking a pipe, is another way of letting time pass, of doing nothing.<br>&nbsp;<br>I fix the drawing. The next drawing, the fourth, is about two men looking hard at one another. Each in his own manner.<br>&nbsp;<br>Maybe the four are not proper drawings but simply sketch maps of an encounter. Maps that may make it less likely to get lost. A question of hope.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was one of these maps that I gave to the Helen Bamber Foundation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Apparently the bidding for it was prolonged and fierce. The bidders were competing to give money to a cause in which they believed, and, in exchange, they hoped to get a little closer to a visionary political thinker, sheltering in the mountains of south-east Mexico.<br>&nbsp;<br>The money the drawing fetched at the auction will help to buy medicines, care, counsellors, nurses, lawyers for Sara or Hamid or Gulsen or Xin . . . <br>&nbsp;<br>We who draw do so not only to make something observed visible to others, but also to accompany something invisible to its incalculable destination.</p><h2>Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Food Rights: The Escalating Battle Over Who Decides What We Eat</h2><p><p>Do Americans have the right to privately obtain the foods of our choice from farmers, neighbors, and local producers, in the same way our grandparents and great grandparents used to do?</p> <p>Yes, say a growing number of people increasingly afraid that the mass-produced food sold at supermarkets is excessively processed, tainted with antibiotic residues and hormones, and lacking in important nutrients. These people, a million or more, are seeking foods outside the regulatory system, like raw milk, custom-slaughtered beef, and pastured eggs from chickens raised without soy, purchased directly from private membership-only food clubs that contract with Amish and other farmers.</p> <p>Public-health and agriculture regulators, however, say no: Americans have no inherent right to eat what they want. In today's ever-more-dangerous food-safety environment, they argue, all food, no matter the source, must be closely regulated, and even barred, if it fails to meet certain standards. These regulators, headed up by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with help from state agriculture departments, police, and district-attorney detectives, are mounting intense and sophisticated investigative campaigns against farms and food clubs supplying privately exchanged food-even handcuffing and hauling off to jail, under threat of lengthy prison terms, those deemed in violation of food laws.</p> <p><em>Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Food Rights</em> takes readers on a disturbing cross-country journey from Maine to California through a netherworld of Amish farmers paying big fees to questionable advisers to avoid the quagmire of America's legal system, secret food police lurking in vans at farmers markets, cultish activists preaching the benefits of pathogens, U.S. Justice Department lawyers clashing with local sheriffs, small Maine towns passing ordinances to ban regulation, and suburban moms worried enough about the dangers of supermarket food that they'll risk fines and jail to feed their children unprocessed, and unregulated, foods of their choosing.</p> <p>Out of the intensity of this unprecedented crackdown, and the creative and spirited opposition that is rising to meet it, a new rallying cry for food rights is emerging.</p></p><p><p>David E. Gumpert has become a nationally recognized writer and authority on the intersection of food, health, and business by virtue of his widely acclaimed book <em>The Raw Milk Revolution: Behind America&#x2019;s Emerging Battle Over Food Rights</em>, as well as his provocative and popular blog, <em>The Complete Patient</em> (www.thecompletepatient.com), and his many articles about food rights on Grist.org and The Huffington Post. He gained behind-the-scenes access to the key participants and vast government documentation necessary to write <em>Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Food Rights</em>. A former reporter with <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and editor at <em>Inc.</em> and <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, Gumpert has brought his considerable investigative and journalistic experience and business expertise (author or coauthor of seven books about small business and entrepreneurship) to bear in articulating the corporate, legal, and political forces driving <em>Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Food Rights.</em></p><p><strong><em>ForeWord Reviews</em>-</strong></p> <p>"Before the advent of pasteurization in the 1860s, there was no food processing and little regulation. Since then, &#x201c;a lot has changed in attitudes and approaches toward food safety,&#x201d; despite what some believe is evidence suggesting chemical processes that match FDA standards are unhealthy and raw foods are not dangerous. So claims journalist David E. Gumpert, who makes a strong case in <em>Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Food Rights </em>that restrictions on raw food distribution and consumption are impinging our basic rights as American citizens. </p> <p>The journey begins when Gumpert introduces readers to Dan Allgyer, an Amish farmer whose home was raided by the FDA when the agency discovered he was selling unpasteurized dairy products to consenting consumers through a food club. Though he&#x2019;d been running his business for many years, Allgyer began to worry when hearing of other farmers who had been forced by the FDA to destroy thousands of dollars worth of food, even made to pour bleach over it so they could not feed it to their own pigs.</p> <p>The examples Gumpert provides of overregulation&#x2014;such as the illegality of raw milk, even when produced for private use by a family cow, and the FDA&#x2019;s destruction of raw foods&nbsp;that tested negative for harmful bacteria&#x2014;are made more assertive by quotes from first-hand witnesses, legal documents, and testimonies, which he skillfully weaves into the narrative to make for both an engaging and authoritative read.</p> <p>Also effective are Gumpert&#x2019;s inclusions of a short history of food processing and FDA regulations, as well as statistics regarding how safe it is to consume raw food. He shares the stories of parents of children with ADHD and asthma who have shown improvement without medication, crediting their health to daily consumption of raw milk. </p> <p>While the lay reader may have difficulties following the pasteurization process lingo and legal jargon, those with knowledge of food regulation, farmers and co-op members, or those interested in public administration, will admire Gumpert&#x2019;s efforts. This book is not simply a portrayal of people who have been affected by the increased enforcement of FDA regulations, but is more significantly an argument against regulations that infringe on Americans&#x2019; rights to choose what they eat or drink." </p><br><br><p><em><strong>Kirkus Reviews-</strong></em></p> <p>"[David] Gumpert (The Raw Milk Revolution: Behind America's Emerging Battle Over Food Rights, 2009, etc.) illustrates how Americans have lost the freedom to make their own decisions when it comes to procuring and consuming food, which he considers outrageous. Through extensive passages on organizations, such as the now-shuttered California-based Rawesome Foods, Washington, D.C.&#x2013;based Grassfed on the Hill, accounts of their Amish suppliers and their encounters with the FDA as well as local public health officials, Gumpert considers some of the still largely unresolved legalities surrounding the sale of raw milk, pastured eggs and other raw foods. He also presents a brief overview of issues familiar to those engaged in food rights activism, including debates on the merits of raw milk in alleviating health problems versus fears of pathogens and outbreaks. Gumpert makes it clear that he sides with the right for private groups to operate without interference, raising basic yet worthy questions on fundamental rights with well-chosen examples of police overreaction, including undercover raids, trespassing, confiscation, mass-disposal of foods and dramatic arrests. Still, he does not write with an overly alarmist tone and fairly portrays the quirks and flaws in the individuals involved&#x2014;e.g., author and war food activist Aajonus Vonderplanitz.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Enriched with historical references ranging from Pasteur to de Tocqueville, this is an accessible, if at times exhaustively detailed, work valuable for its reportage of incidents that have remained largely unknown to the average citizen."</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;It seems far-fetched to think that &#x2018;police&#x2019; in black suits would make an assault on what we-the-people have forever assumed was our right to eat what we want to eat. Based on an extraordinary journalistic investigation, David Gumpert makes a compelling case that we are witnessing a concerted national program to shut down the buying and selling of pure, wholesome, unadulterated food&#x2014;farm by farm and state by state. These&nbsp;assaults, being carried out on farmers in the name of &#x2018;food safety,&#x2019; are jeopardizing our basic liberties, which must include access to foods that keep us healthy. There is no bigger story, and Gumpert has told it in a compelling, highly readable fashion.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong>--Abby Rockefeller, president of the Resource Institute for Low Entropy Systems and author of the scientific paper &#x201c;Civilization and Sludge&#x201d;</strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;A wakeup call for anyone who eats, <em>Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Food Rights </em>is an expos� on the American government&#x2019;s calculated attack and sinister use of brute force on family farmers and consumers involved in the local food movement.&nbsp;Through harrowing tales of government spying and raids, David Gumpert demonstrates how complacency has allowed corporations to manipulate federal agencies and gain complete control of our entire food supply.&nbsp;If you care about what your family eats, read this book.&#x201d;<strong>--Linda Faillace, author of <em>Mad Sheep: The True Story of the USDA&#x2019;s War on a Family Farm</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;An issue this important should have its own revolutionary flag. The image would show a farmer and a neighbor exchanging food above the classic motto &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t tread on me.&#x2019; This is a revolution that needs to happen. What could be more important to all of us than control over the quality of food we put in our bodies?&#x201d;<strong>--Eliot Coleman, author of&nbsp;<em>The Winter Harvest Handbook</em>,&nbsp;<em>Four-Season Harvest,&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;The New Organic Grower</em></strong></p><br><br><p><em><strong>Publishers Weekly-</strong></em></p> <p>"Journalist Gumpert (<em>The Raw Milk Revolution: Behind America&#x2019;s Emerging Battle Over Food Rights</em>) chronicles the increasing government regulator crackdowns on private food clubs and the farmers who provide for them, drawing vocal and heretofore unnoticed attention to the lack of freedom Americans have over what they eat, due to the watchful eye of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The book contains many disturbing examples, from the farmer who faced jail time for providing raw milk to customers without proper licensing or labeling&#x2014;though they were clamoring for the product, owned the cows through a co-op, and also never became sick&#x2014;to the distributors for food clubs who saw close to six figures worth of food destroyed by regulators on cursory evidence, followed by their own trip in the back of a paddy wagon. Unfortunately, the book reads like a call to arms for those who already share Gumpert&#x2019;s point of view. The book would have benefitted from further discussion of the few examples where people did become sick from private food sources, and analysis of the government regulators&#x2019; perspective. Despite the occasionally chaotic narrative, Gumpert commendably draws attention to a multitude of injustices committed in the name of food safety."</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;With incredible clarity and masterful storytelling, David Gumpert leads us on a journey into the trenches of America&#x2019;s battle over food rights. No one knows this terrain and understands the implications as thoroughly as Gumpert, and the result is a book that will by turns enrage and inspire you. The battle for the right to nourish our bodies with real food&nbsp;<em>must </em>be won, and this book is an essential part of making that happen.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong>--Ben Hewitt, author of <em>The Town That Food Saved: How One Community Found Vitality in Local Food&nbsp;</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;This book will get you fired up! David Gumpert makes an eloquent case for the importance of food rights and documents the actions of government regulators against small farms and buyers clubs. These infuriating stories are woven together and contextualized by Gumpert&#x2019;s insightful legal and political analysis. For anyone interested in reclaiming food, this book shows you that you are part of a larger political struggle.&#x201d;&nbsp;<strong>--Sandor Ellix Katz, author of <em>The Art of Fermentation</em>, <em>The Revolution Will Not Be Microwaved</em>, and <em>Wild Fermentation&nbsp;</em></strong></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;The 18th century was the century of political rights; the 19th century was the century of women&#x2019;s rights; the 20th century was the century of civil rights.&nbsp;The challenge of the 21st century will be the struggle for food and farming rights.&nbsp;Thanks to the work of David Gumpert in chronicling this ongoing battle, we have a roadmap for establishing the right to access the foods of our choice.&nbsp; <em>Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Food Rights</em> is highly recommended for anyone interested in family farms and nutrient-dense food.&#x201d;<strong>--Sally Fallon Morell, president, The Weston A.

Written when she was only twenty-three, Evans's story of two black, blue-collar fifteen-year-old girls' flirtation with adulthood for one night was startling in its pitch-perfect examination of race, class, and the shifting terrain of adolescence. <br><br> Now this debut collection delivers on the promise of that early story. In "Harvest," a college student's unplanned pregnancy forces her to confront her own feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her white classmates. In "Jellyfish," a father's misguided attempt to rescue a gift for his grown daughter from an apartment collapse magnifies all he doesn't know about her. And in "Snakes," the mixed-race daughter of intellectuals recounts the disastrous summer she spent with her white grandmother and cousin, a summer that has unforeseen repercussions in the present. <br><br> Striking in their emotional immediacy, the stories in <i>Before You Suffocate Your Own Fool Self</i> are based in a world where inequality is reality but where the insecurities of adolescence and young adulthood, and the tensions within family and the community, are sometimes the biggest complicating forces in one's sense of identity and the choices one makes.</p><p><i>Danielle Evans</i> is a graduate of Columbia University and the Iowa Writers' Workshop. Her stories have appeared in <i>The Paris Review</i>, <i>A Public Space</i>, and <i>The Best American Short Stories 2008</i>.<b>Virgins</b><p>Me and Jasmine and Michael were hanging out at Mr. Thompson's pool. We were fifteen and it was the first weekend after school started, and me and Jasmine were sitting side by side on one of Mr. Thompson's ripped-up green-and-white lawn chairs, doing each other's nails while the radio played "Me Against the World." It was the day after Tupac got shot, and even Hot 97, which hadn't played any West Coast for months, wasn't playing anything else. Jasmine kept complaining that Michael smelled like bananas.</p><p>"Sunscreen," Jasmine said, "is some white-people shit. That's them white girls you've been hanging out with, got you wearing sunscreen. Black people don't burn."</p><p>Never mind that Michael was lighter than Jasmine and I was lighter than Michael, and really all three of us burned. Earlier, when Jasmine had gone to the bathroom, I'd let Michael rub sunscreen gently into my back. I guess I smelled like bananas, too, but I couldn't smell anything but the polish, and I didn't think she could, either. Jasmine was on about some other stuff.</p><p>"You smell like food," Jasmine said. "I don't know why you wanna smell like food. Ain't nobody here gonna lick you because you smell like bananas. Maybe that shit works in Bronxville, but not with us."</p><p>"I don't want you to lick me," Michael said. "I don't know where your mouth has been. I know you don't never shut it."</p><p>"Shut up," I said. They were my only two real friends and if they fought I'd've had to fix it. I turned up the dial on Mr. Thompson's radio, which was big and old. The metal had deep scratches on it, and rust spots left by people like us, who didn't watch to see whether or not we'd flicked drops of water on it. It had a good sound, though. When the song was over they cut to some politician from the city saying again that it was a shame talented young black people kept dying like this, and it was time to do something about it. They'd been saying that all day. Mr. Thompson got up and cut off the radio.</p><p>"You live like a thug, you die like a thug," he said, looking at us. "It's nothing to cry over when people wake up in the beds they made."</p><p>He was looking for an argument, but I didn't say nothing, and Jasmine didn't, either. Part of swimming in Mr. Thompson's pool was that he was always saying stuff like that. It still beat swimming at the city pool, which had closed for the season last weekend, and before that had been closed for a week after someone got beat up there. When it was open it was crowded and dirty from little kids who peed in it, and was usually full of people who were always trying to start something. People like Michael, who had nothing better to do.</p><p>"I'm not crying for nobody," Michael told Mr. Thompson. "Tupac been dead to me since he dissed B.I.G." He looked up and made some bootleg version of the sign of the cross, like he was talking about God or something. He must've seen it in a movie.</p><p>Mr. Thompson shook his head at us and walked back to the lawn chair where he'd been reading the paper. He let it crinkle loudly when he opened it again, like even the sound of someone else reading would make us less ignorant.</p><p>Jasmine snorted. She lifted Michael's sweatshirt with the tips of her thumb and index finger so she didn't scratch her still-drying polish and pulled out the pictures he had been showing us before Mr. Thompson came over photos of his latest girlfriend, a brunette with big eyes and enormous breasts, lying on a bed with a lot of ruffles on it.</p><p>"You live like a white girl, you act like a white girl," said Jasmine, frowning at the picture and making her voice deep like she was Mr. Thompson.</p><p>"She's not white," said Michael. "She's Italian."</p><p>Jasmine squinted at the girl's penny-sized pink nipples. "She look white to me."</p><p>"She's Italian," said Michael.</p><p>"Italian people ain't white?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"What the fuck are they, then?"</p><p>"Italian."</p><p>"Mr. Thompson," Jasmine called across the yard, "are Italian people white?"</p><p>"Ask the Ethiopians," said Mr. Thompson, and none of us knew what the hell he was talking about, so we all shut up for a minute.</p><p>The air started to feel cooler through our swimsuits, and Michael got up, putting his jeans on over his wet swim trunks and pulling his sweatshirt over his head. I followed Jasmine into the house, where we took turns changing in the downstairs bathroom. It was an old house, like most of the ones in his part of town, but Mr. Thompson kept it nice: the wallpaper was peeling a little, but the bathroom was clean. The soap in the soap dish was shaped like a seashell, and it seemed like we were the only ones who ever used it. On our way out we said good-bye to Mr. Thompson, who nodded at us and grunted, "Girls"; then, harsher, at Michael: "Boy."</p><p>Michael rolled his eyes. Michael wasn't bad. Mostly I thought he hung out with us because he was bored a lot. He needed somebody to chill with when the white girls he was fucking's parents were home. We didn't get him in trouble as much as his boys did. We hung out with him because we figured it was easier to have a boy around than not to. Strangers usually thought one of us was with him, and they didn't know which, so they didn't bother either of us. When you were alone, men were always wanting something from you. We even wondered about Mr. Thompson sometimes, or at least we never went swimming at his house without Michael with us.</p><p>Mr. Thompson was retired, but he used to be our elementary school principal, which is how he was the only person in Mount Vernon we knew with a swimming pool in his backyard. We and everybody else we knew lived on the south side, where it was mostly apartment buildings, and if you had a house, you were lucky if your backyard was big enough for a plastic kiddie pool. The bus didn't go by Mr. Thompson's house, and it was a twenty-minute walk from our houses even if we walked fast, but it was nicer than swimming at the city pool. We were the only ones he'd told could use his pool anytime.</p><p>"It's 'cause I collected more than anyone else for the fourth-grade can drive, when we got the computers," I said. "He likes me."</p><p>"Nah," Jasmine said, "he don't even remember that. It's 'cause my mom worked at the school all those years."</p><p>Jasmine's mom had been one of the lunch ladies, and we'd gone out of our way to pretend not to know her, with her hairnet cutting a line into her broad forehead, her face all covered in sweat. Even when she got home she'd smell like grease for hours. Sometimes if my mother made me a bag lunch, I'd split it with Jasmine so we didn't have to go through the lunch line and hear the other kids laugh. At school, Mr. Thompson had been nicer to Jasmine's mother than we had. We felt bad for letting Mr. Thompson make us nervous. He was the smartest man either of us knew, and probably he was just being nice. We were not stupid, though. We'd had enough nice guys suddenly look at us the wrong way.</p><p>My first kiss was with a boy who'd said he'd walk me home and a block later was licking my mouth. The first time a guy had ever touched me like touched me <i>there</i> I was eleven and he was sixteen and a lifeguard at the city pool. We'd been playing chicken and when he put me down he held me against the cement and put his fingers in me, and I wasn't scared or anything, just cold and surprised. When I told Jasmine later she said he did that to everyone, her too. Michael kept people like that out of our way. People had used to say that he was fucking one of us, or trying to, but it wasn't like that. He was our friend, and he'd moved on to white girls from Bronxville anyway. It was like he didn't even see us like girls sometimes, and that felt nice because mostly everybody else did.</p><br><p>Michael's brother Ron was leaned up against his car, waiting for him at the bottom of Mr. Thompson's hill. The car was a brown Cadillac that was older than Ron, who graduated from our high school last spring and worked at Radio Shack. People didn't usually notice the car much because they were too busy looking at Ron and he knew it. He was golden-colored, with curly hair and doll-baby eyelashes and the kind of smile where you could count all of his teeth. Jasmine always said how fine he was, but to me he looked like the kind of person who should be on television, not someone you'd actually wanna talk to. He must've still been mad at Pac, too, or he was just tired of hearing him on the radio, because he was bumping Nas from the tape deck. Michael hopped in the front seat and started to wave bye to us.</p><p>"Man," Ron said, cuffing him on the back of his head. "You got two cute girls here, and you ain't even gonna try to take 'em with you? I thought I raised you better than that."</p><p>"I'm meeting people at the Galleria. You coming?" Michael called.</p><p>"Who's gonna be there?" Jasmine asked.</p><p>"Me, Darius, Eddie...; prolly some other people."</p><p>"Nuh-uh," Jasmine said. "You're cool, but your boy ain't."</p><p>"What's wrong with my boy?" Michael asked, grinning.</p><p>Jasmine made a <i>tsk</i> sound. "He ignorant, that's what."</p><p>"Damn son," said Ron as he walked back to the driver's side. "Your whole crew can't get no play." He got in, slammed the car door, and did a U-turn. On his way past us he leaned out the window and called, "You get tired of messing with these fools, you come down to the mall and see <i>me</i>," then rolled up the amber window and drove off .</p><p>Jasmine's problem was that she had lost her virginity to Michael's friend Eddie four months before. He told her he would go with her afterward but instead he went with Cindy Jackson. We saw them all over the city all summer, holding hands. It drove Jasmine crazy. Jasmine liked to pretend no one knew any of this, even though JASMINE FUCKED EDDIE AND NOW SHE'S PRESSED!! had been written in both the boys' and girls' bathrooms at school for months. Cindy wrote it in both places. I told Jasmine Cindy was probably real familiar with the boys' bathroom.</p><p>"The only difference between that girl and the subway," I said, "is that everybody in the world hasn't ridden the subway."</p><p>I thought Jasmine would feel better, but instead of laughing she sniffled and said, "He left me for some trashy bitch." After that I just let her cry.</p><br><p>On our way to Jasmine's house, she said, "I'm sad about Tupac, a little. It is sad. You can't ever do anything. I bet you if I got famous, somebody would kill me too."</p><p>"What the hell would you get famous for?" I asked.</p><p>"I'm just saying, if I did."</p><p>"Sure," I said. "You'd be just like Tupac."</p><p>"I'm just saying, Erica, you never know. You don't know what could happen. You don't know how much time you got."</p><p>Jasmine could be melodramatic like that, thinking because something bad happened somewhere, something bad would happen to you. I remembered when Tupac had went to jail, and Jasmine cried because she said we could get arrested too, and I said, "<i>For what?</i>", but it didn't matter, she just kept crying. Mostly to make her feel better, we had bought it's a set up so keep ya head up T-shirts at the mall. My mother screamed when she saw us wearing them.</p><p>"<i>Setup</i>," she said. "Y'all take that crap off. Keep believing everything these rap stars tell you. I'm telling you, the minute a man says someone set him up for anything, you run, because he's about to set you up for something."</p><p>There were a whole lot of men we were supposed to stay away from according to my mother: rap stars, NBA players, white men. We didn't really know any of those kinds of people. We only knew boys like Michael who freestyled a little but mostly not well, who played ball violently like someone's life was at stake, or else too pretty, flexing for the girls every time they made a decent shot, because even they knew they would never make the NBA, and we were all they were gonna get out of a good game. The only white men we knew were teachers and cops, and no one had to tell us to try and stay away from them, when that was all we did in the first place, but my mother was always worried about something she didn't need to be.</p><br><p>When we got to Jasmine's apartment, we went straight to her room, which felt almost like it was my room too. We lived two blocks from each other and slept at each other's house as much as we slept at our own. My schoolbooks were still piled on the corner of her floor, my second bathing suit was hanging over her desk chair, where I'd left it to dry last weekend. Me and Jasmine always shared everything, and after I showered I went through Jasmine's closet like I would have gone through mine, looking for something to wear out later. Only this year was sharing things getting to be a problem, because we were starting to be built different. I put on a pair of Jasmine's jeans, which were tight around my hips and she told me so. "Look at you, stretching out my jeans with your big old ass," was what she actually said.</p><p>"You wish you had my ass," I said, which was true, she did, because hers was flat like a board and people teased her about it. Jasmine was small but all the meat she had on her was settled in her tummy, which was a cute little puff now but would be a gut someday if she ever got fat. It made me happy sometimes to think that even though Jasmine's face was better than mine, if I ever got fat I'd get fat the way my mother had, all in the hips and chest, and some people would still be all right with that, more than if I had a big giant stomach like Jasmine might one day. We weren't bad-looking, neither one of us, but we weren't ever going to be beautiful, either, I knew that already. We were the kind of girls who would always be very pretty <i>if</i> but <i>if</i> never seemed to happen. If Jasmine's skin cleared up and she could keep her hair done and she did something about her teeth, which were a little crooked, and if I lost five pounds and got contact lenses and did something about the way my skin was always ashy, maybe we'd be the prettiest girls in Mount Vernon, but we weren't, we were just us. Jasmine had beautiful dark eyes and the most perfect nose I ever saw on anybody, and I had nice lips and a pretty good shape, and that was it. We got dressed to go to the movies because there was nothing else to do, and even though Jasmine's pants were a little tight on me and the shirt I'd borrowed was pushing my chest up in my face, I looked all right, just maybe like I was trying too hard.</p><br><p>When we got to the lobby of the new movie theatre, I told Jasmine I liked the way it was done up: the ceiling was gold and glittery and the carpet was still fire-truck red and not dingy burgundy like red carpet usually was. Jasmine said she thought the whole thing looked fake and tacky, and speaking of fake and tacky, look who was here. It was Cindy, in some tight jeans and a shirt that said baby girl and showed off the rhinestone she had stuck to her belly button. Eddie was there, too, and Michael and a bunch of their friends, and they waved us over. When Cindy saw Jasmine she ran up and hugged her, and Jasmine hugged her back, like they hadn't been calling each other skank-ass bitches five minutes ago. The boys all looked confused, because boys are stupid like that.</p><p>"Look what Eddie gave me," said Cindy, all friendly. She pulled a pink teddy bear out of h...</p></p><h2>Black Elk Speaks</h2><p>Black Elk Speaks. The Legendary Book Of Visions Of An American Indian</p><p><p>John G.

Some of the essays . . . use fieldwork to investigate the functions of affects&#x2014;among organized sex workers, health care workers, and in the modeling industry. Others employ the discourses of microbiology, thermodynamics, information sciences, and cinema studies to rethink the body and the affects in terms of technology. Still others explore the affects of trauma in the context of immigration and war. And throughout all the essays run serious theoretical reflections on the powers of the affects and the political possibilities they pose for research and practice.&#x201d;&#x2014;Michael Hardt, from the foreword<p></p><p>In the mid-1990s, scholars turned their attention toward the ways that ongoing political, economic, and cultural transformations were changing the realm of the social, specifically that aspect of it described by the notion of affect: pre-individual bodily forces, linked to autonomic responses, which augment or diminish a body&#x2019;s capacity to act or engage with others. This &#x201c;affective turn&#x201d; and the new configurations of bodies, technology, and matter that it reveals, is the subject of this collection of essays. Scholars based in sociology, cultural studies, science studies, and women&#x2019;s studies illuminate the movement in thought from a psychoanalytically informed criticism of subject identity, representation, and trauma to an engagement with information and affect; from a privileging of the organic body to an exploration of nonorganic life; and from the presumption of equilibrium-seeking closed systems to an engagement with the complexity of open systems under far-from-equilibrium conditions. Taken together, these essays suggest that attending to the affective turn is necessary to theorizing the social.</p><p><i>Contributors</i>. Jamie &#x201c;Skye&#x201d; Bianco, Grace M.

Myer and American racism</h2><p>Analyzing the career of Dillon S. Myer, Director of the War Relocation Authority during WWII and Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs from 1950-53, Richard Drinnon shows that the pattern for the Japanese internment was set a century earlier by the removal, confinement, and scattering of Native Americans.</p><p>In this important study Drinnon brings together evidence of the mistreatment of Japanese-Americans during World War II and American Indians during the Korean War, showing how government policy in both cases grew out of "traditional racism." This policy is neatly exemplified in the person of a colorless bureaucrat named Dillon Myer who headed the War Relocation Authority (19421946) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (19501953), presiding over twin calamities for groups of American citizens about whom he was appallingly ignorant. Drinnon describes the illegal incarceration of Japanese-Americans, the systematic breaking up of families, the establishment of penal colonies for "troublemakers" and Myer's declaration of administrative war on Native Americans. What is most shocking about this well-told but sorry tale is the abundant evidence of serene self-righteousness with which all this was carried out. Drinnon, a history professor at Bucknell, wrote Facing West: The Metaphysics of Indian-Hating and Empire-Building. Photos. (December<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Drinnon uses this study of a second-level federal official to uncover the depth of institutional racism in 20th-century America. Myer, an undistinguished and culturally naive bureaucrat, ran Japanese-American relocation camps during World War II. Never willing to challenge a system that rewarded him with responsibility, Myer typified what Drinnon portrays as the dominant racism that assumed the worst of minorities. During the 1950s Myer assumed an important role in another controversial episode of racism, the attempt to force Indians into the mainstream by eliminating tribal reservations. Based largely on obscure public records and memoirs, this study indicts the system. Drinnon's heavy-handed anger sometimes becomes obtrusive, but this is still a good book. Charles K.

On the surface, <i>Appetites</i> may appear to be about eating&#x2014;-complete with Knapp's unflinching account of her anorexia. In fact, Knapp is writing about how every woman can decipher her hunger and loneliness by connecting with her desire to experience pleasure. She illuminates the ways in which cultural taboos about women who desire create vulnerability to disorders of appetite including food and alcohol addictions, compulsive shopping and promiscuous sex. In this expansive view, "one woman&#x2019;s tub of cottage cheese is another woman&#x2019;s maxed-out Master Card." Readers will nod in recognition as the author seamlessly weaves autobiography and anthropology, describing her family of origin, profiling women of appetite and countering what she calls "the culture of No!" that curbs and disguises women's desires. Knapp gets to yes by urging readers to ask: "What gives me delight and fully engages me?" Knowing that 42-year-old Knapp died of lung cancer makes this question all the more poignant. Such questions suggest Knapp&#x2019;s brave and generous legacy. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i>Caroline Knapp was the author of <i>Alice K's Guide to Life</i> as well as the best-selling books <i>Drinking: A Love Story</i> and <i>Pack of Two</i>.

His work has successfully shaped the Left, increased government accountability, made possible new laws, and served as a powerful check against abuses of corporate power. In this landmark collection, the essays that reveal the intellectual, social, and political underpinnings of this legendary citizen advocate are brought together for the first time.<br>In The Ralph Nader Reader, we follow the trajectory of Nader's concerns from 1956 to the present and his personal evolution from consumer advocate to presidential candidate. The result is a monumental book, an invaluable resource for anyone interested in a unique vision of democracy that places citizenship over consumerism, communities over corporations, and public interest over private power.</p><p>In a pop media culture dominated by dismissive irony and cloying sentimentalism, how do we talk about a true American political hero? The answer is, we don't. After 40 years in the trenches, Ralph Nader, the standard-bearer in the battle for the rights of the disenfranchised and the consummate American citizen, is still being ignored by the mass media. Reading <i>The Ralph Nader Reader</i> may lead one to view that oversight as less than accidental.<p> Nader has tilted against injustice wherever he has found it, and he has found it in spades in corporate America. Beginning with his crusade against the auto industry in the early 1960s, Nader went on to fight for the rights of workers by helping create the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as well as for a citizen's right for access to government documents in the creation of the Freedom of Information Act. He has often stood resolute before the juggernaut--and more often than not, the juggernaut has flinched. His investigation of corporate crime led him to see a far-reaching problem of accountability. Corporations are supposed to be accountable to the people and laws of America, but what happens when the government exempts corporations from these responsibilities? Nader gives one of many shocking examples: "Of America's 250 most profitable corporations in 1988, 45 reduced their tax liability to less than 10%, 6 received refunds." This and countless other examples of corporate-government malfeasance have led Nader to focus increasingly on reestablishing democracy in America. He advocates citizen groups at the local level to be watchdogs for their own interests--be it as voters, taxpayers, workers, consumers, or shareholders. "It is time for a civic rebellion, Jeffersonian style," he writes.</p><p> So is there an effort to keep Nader out of the media? When you realize, as Nader points out repeatedly, that one corporation owns 800 radio stations across the U.S., that a handful of corporations control the vast majority of television networks, and that <i>The New York Times</i> owns <i>The Boston Globe</i>, you see that he has ticked off the wrong people if he wants his voice to be heard in America. But his voice speaks clearly in this book, and gives us all an ideal of citizenship and democratic action to strive for. But beware <i>The Ralph Nader Reader</i>--once you take the red pill, you'll have to see how deep the rabbit hole goes, and once you see, you may find yourself doing something about it. <i>--Steve Andersen</i></p>For over four decades RALPH NADER has challenged corporations, government agencies, and institutions to be more accountable to the public. From fighting for car safety in the 1960s, to opposing the policies of the World Trade Organization, to running for president, Nader continues to be a relentless force for grassroots activism and democratic change.</p><h2>The Twelfth Card: A Lincoln Rhyme Novel (Lincoln Rhyme Novels)</h2><p>Trying to discover why innocuous man-turned-killer Thompson Boyd is targeting a Harlem high school student for murder, quadriplegic detective Lincoln Rhyme and his prot�g�e, Amelia Sachs, look for answers in the would-be-victim&#39;s term paper about her civil rights activist ancestor. 300,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Jeffery Deaver</b> is the international number-one bestselling author of <i>Roadside Crosses, The Bodies Left Behind</i>, <i>The Broken Window, The Sleeping Doll, The Bone Collector </i>and twenty-one other suspense novels. His books have been translated into twenty-five languages. He has been nominated for six Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America and is a three-time recipient of the Ellery Queen Reader&#x2019;s Award for Best Short Story of the Year. His novel <i>The Bone Collector</i> was made into a feature release from Universal Pictures, starring Denzel Washington. Deaver was born in Chicago, attended the University of Missouri and received his law degree from Fordham University in New York. In 1990, he quit practicing law to write full-time. Readers can visit his website at www.jefferydeaver.com.While the plot of Deaver's most recent Lincoln Rhyme thriller strains credulity, Dennis Boutsikaris's narration makes it a winning hand. Rhyme must find out why a seasoned killer is attempting to kill a 16-year-old Harlem girl. Geneva is researching a one-hundred-forty-year-old mystery concerning a disgraced ancestor. Rhyme and his sidekick, Amelia Sachs, have always been an engrossing pair. The trouble is there's not enough of them. Boutsikaris's glib narration saves the day, propelling listeners through the twists and turns of the complex plot. Boutsikaris also comfortably handles the street talk of Geneva and her friends. While Deaver's latest isn't all aces, because of Boutsikaris's performance, it's not a pass either.

Uhura befriended a diplomat from Eeiauo, the land of graceful, cat-like beings. The two women exchanged songs and promised never to reveal their secret. </p><p> Now the U.S.S. <i>Enterprise?</i> is orbiting Eeiauo in a desperate race to save the inhabitants before a deadly plague destroys them. Uhura's secret songs may hold the key to a cure -- but the clues are veiled in layers of mystery. The plague is killing humans, threatening other planets -- and Kirk must crack the code before the Starship <i>Enterprise</i> succumbs!</p></p><p><p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> <i>Captain's Log,</i> Stardate 2950.3: </p><p> The <i>Enterprise</i> continues in orbit around Eeiauo, on the outermost fringe of Federation space. At McCoy's recommendation, Starfleet has placed the world under quarantine. The <i>Enterprise</i> will remain here to enforce that quarantine until the arrival of a Federation task force, specialists in epidemiology and in enforcement. </p><p> Dr. McCoy and Nurse Chapel have elected to beam down with the medical team we transported to aid the Eeiauoans in their desperate fight against the plague that is devastating their world -- a plague they call "The Long Death." </p><p> <i>Personal Log,</i> James T. Kirk, Stardate 2950.3: </p><p> Bones, at least, has something useful to do. Ile rest of us can only sit and listen, as more and more Eeiauoans are struck down. Over a quarter of the population now has ADF syndrome. If only the Eeiauoans had asked for help sooner! </p><p> I told Bones of our frustration. His response was predictable... </p><p> <i>"You're</i> frustrated! By God, Jim!" McCoy let his exasperated words hang for a moment, then he stepped slightly to one side. </p><p> "<i>Bozhe moi,"</i> breathed Pavel Chekov as he watched the viewscreen; it was nothing less than a prayer. To Kirk's right, Lieutenant Uhura gave a small wordless gasp. </p><p> Even a clinical knowledge of ADF syndrome left Jim Kirk unprepared for the view behind McCoy. Consciously, he knew the miles that separated him from the scene, but he was still hard put not to take an involuntary step backward. </p><p> He saw row after row after row of the circular Eeiauoan hospital beds, each one occupied. The victims of ADF were no longer recognizably Eeiauoan: they lay as if dead, their furless bodies covered with raw, oozing lesions. From Bones's briefing, Jim Kirk knew that, given adequate intravenous feeding and similar maintenance, they could survive in this state for years. <i>If you call this survival,</i> he thought. Seeing them, he didn't. </p><p> Those in the early, ambulatory stage of the disease hunched in their pain, brushed away their loosening fur and carried on the work of maintaining the others. </p><p> The Eeiauoans had not asked the Federation for assistance until they no longer had the power to help themselves. </p><p> McCoy blocked the view again. </p><p> "Sorry, Bones," Kirk said, when he found his voice. "That was a stupid thing for me to say." </p><p> McCoy shook his head. "The Eeiauoan doctors have dealt with two previous outbreaks of ADF syndrome and never bothered to call in Federation help before. It wasn't bad enough, they tell me. Wasn't bad enough! Jim, they lost twenty thousand people in the last one!" He himself looked on the verge of collapse, but Kirk was relieved to see that he still had the energy for righteous indignation. </p><p> "Are you making any progress, Bones?" </p><p> McCoy snorted. "'Progress.' If that's a polite way of askin' have we found a cure yet, the answer is no. Nor have we cobbled together a vaccine in our copious spare time. Give me all the time in the world and the greatest scientists and doctors in history and even then I couldn't promise you results, dammit. I can't <i>command</i> a scientific breakthrough." </p><p> He drew a long breath, his shoulders slumped. "I wish to hell I could. They're good people." With a flash of his old humor, he added, " -- for overgrown house cats." </p><p> "Is there anything we can do, anything at all?" </p><p> "You're supposed to be enforcin' the quarantine, not breakin' it. No, I don't want anyone else down here. The best you could do is carry bedpans, and robots do that well enough. And they, at least, are immune to ADF syndrome." </p><p> "Bones, when was the last time you heard of a disease that affects two species as different as humans and Eeiauoans?" </p><p> "Rabies," said McCoy curtly. At Kirk's questioning look, he added, by way of explanation, "An ancient Earth disease -- it did indeed affect two species as different as..." He waved his hand. "The planet's under quarantine, Jim, and I don't want to hear any more about it." </p><p> A tall Eeiauoan tapped McCoy lightly on the shoulder with a claw tip. He turned. "Yes, Quickfoot?" </p><p> Quickfoot of Srallansre, the Eeiauoan doctor McCoy had been working with since their arrival, was obviously in the first stage of ADF syndrome. Each movement she made was stiff with pain. Her gray-striped fur was already thinning and dingy. Her nictitating membranes, discolored and swollen, partially obstructed her vision. Although she did not yet have the characteristic pained hunched posture, Kirk suspected it was from force of will only. </p><p> McCoy accepted a sheaf of papers from her. "Get some rest, dammit, Quickfoot," he said irritably. "Finish that later." </p><p> Quickfoot shook her head stiffly. "Too ssoon, too much resst, McCCoy. Work <i>now.</i> There is no <i>later."</i> She limped away. </p><p> McCoy wiped his face and eyes. "Damn cat hair," he muttered, "gets in everything." Kirk nodded, accepting the fiction. After a pause, McCoy straightened and said, "I have some more information for Mr. Spock." </p><p> Casting a quick, puzzled glance at his chief science officer, Kirk said, "I thought we transhipped a hold fun of medical computers?" </p><p> McCoy muttered a response. </p><p> "How's that, Bones?" Jim Kirk was quite sure he had heard McCoy correctly -- but baiting McCoy was a habit of long standing and seemed to restore a measure of normality even in such grotesque circumstances as these. </p><p> McCoy scowled. "I said," and this time he enunciated each word clearly, "I'd rather trust Spock." </p><p> At Spock's raised eyebrow, McCoy scowled again. Then, very rapidly, to change the subject, he said, "How's Sulu?" </p><p> The forced inaction these past few weeks had given everyone time to return to hobbies or create new ones from sheer desperation. Sulu had found McCoy's substitute, Dr. Evan Wilson, a fencing partner his equal -- or better. Hard-pressed during a recent match with her, he had tripped and, against all odds, broken his ankle. </p><p> The thought of Wilson touched a nerve. Privately, Jim Kirk resented her presence on behalf of the <i>Enterprise's</i> own medical staff. It was not the first time Starfleet Command had shown such a lack of judgment however, and he was not about to mention his feelings in public. Morale was low enough already; it would not do to have his crew questioning their acting chief medical officer. He said, "Sulu's fine. Dr. Wilson says he'll be up and around in no time." </p><p> "'Up and around'? How did she get him to stay down?" </p><p> Until Bones's question, it hadn't occurred to him to wonder. Jim Kirk spread his hands and glanced at his chief science officer inquiringly. </p><p> Spock said, "I believe she learned her bedside manner from you, Doctor." </p><p> "What d'you mean by that, Spock?" </p><p> "I mean, Dr. McCoy, that she used a purely emotional approach." Spock's features were innocent of expression. </p><p> Now openly suspicious, McCoy growled, "I'm waiting, Mr. Spock." </p><p> Spock raised an eyebrow, presumably at McCoy's display of impatience, then said, "Dr. Wilson was heard to tell Mr. Sulu that if he did not stay off his injured leg, she would -- I quote -- break the other one for him." </p><p> Jim Kirk gave an inward cheer. He could not have delivered the tale half so well himself, and for the life of him, he couldn't tell if Spock had done it intentionally. </p><p> Intentional or not, the story, or Spock's delivery, actually brought a surprised chuckle from McCoy. He gave Spock a wary look, then turned back to Kirk, and said, "Feisty little thing, isn't she? Keep your eye on her, Jim. What she lacks in height, she makes up in brass. Get her to tell you how Scotty and I met her. Might give you a laugh and, God knows, we could all use a few." </p><p> Then his brief smile faded and there was a long moment's silence. Kirk could see McCoy's mind turning back to the desperateness of the problem he faced.

She has moved to an island at the far reaches of the continent to restore the house of an equally haunted figure, her mysterious great-uncle; but as her life begins to rebuild itself along with the house, his story starts to wrap around hers. Powerful forces are stirring, but Rae cannot see where her reality leaves off and his fate begins.<br><br>Fifty-two years old, Rae must battle the feelings that have long tormented her -- panic, melancholy, and a skin-crawling sense of watchers behind the trees. Before she came here, she believed that most of the things she feared existed only in her mind. And who can say, as disturbing incidents multiply, if any of the watchers on Folly Island might be real? Is Rae paranoid, as her family and the police believe, or is the threat real? Is the island alive with promise -- or with dangers? <br><br>With <b>Folly</b>, award-winning author Laurie R. King once again powerfully redefines psychological suspense on a sophisticated and harrowing new level, and proves why legions of readers and reviewers have named her a master of the genre.</p><p>"The thing about madness was, it just took so damn much energy, and it was so thoroughly tedious in the meantime." Master woodworker Rae Newborn knows madness intimately, with every bone, every pore, every particle of her being. At 52, with three suicide attempts, extended hospitalizations, the death of her husband and daughter, and a vicious attack behind her, Rae has come to Folly Island, far out in the Straits of Juan de Fuca, to rebuild her life by building a house: <blockquote>She would pull herself together, she would go and rebuild Desmond's house, she would lift his walls and dwell within them quietly all the rest of her days. Everything that House was lay there waiting for her to take it up: House as shelter, House as permanence, House as a continuation and a legacy, comfort and challenge, safety and beauty, symbol and reality joined as one.</blockquote> Bequeathed to Rae by Desmond Newborn, a great-uncle she never met, Folly Island is lovely indeed. But when Rae discovers Desmond's journal in the 70-year-old ruins of his house, she learns that Desmond had his own internal horrors to confront on the island. As she labors in solitude, her prickly nature deterring all but the most determined of her would-be neighbors, it's not just her well-being that's at stake. Rae must prove herself sane if she is to have any contact with her beloved granddaughter Petra. So when the "skin-crawling feeling of being watched" doesn't fade, she does her best to ignore it. But does paranoia have its roots in reality? And is Rae doomed to repeat her ancestor's tragic end?<p> So effectively does King weave together past and present--the shrouded history of Desmond's life and death on Folly, and the tense, dusty, exhilaratingly panicky account of Rae's wrestling with old demons and new timber--that the future seems less important than the author might have wished. In other words, the eventual unmasking of Rae's watcher pales in comparison to the gradual revelation of Rae herself within King's haunted and haunting narrative. But with such a strong character and such moodily lovely prose, readers shouldn't miss the denouement-driven trappings of standard suspense. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>"Acclaimed mystery writer King has crafted a labyrinthian tale that is as haunting as it is touching."<br>-- <i>People</i></p><h2>Soun Tetoken: Nez Perce Boy Tames a Stallion (Amazing Indian Children Series)</h2><p>Although mute since the death of his parents in a fire, a young Nez Perc�e Indian boy has a happy and adventurous life with his adopted family until the growing conflict between the white man and the Indians erupts into war in the summer of 1877 and changes his life forever.Mute since the death of his parents, a Nez Perce boy must face the growing conflict that erupts into war in 1877</p><p></p><h2>Scenes from a Marriage</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

Pratchett returns to his first Discworld protagonist, the inept and cowardly wizard Rincewind, who habitually runs into trouble as fast as he flees. Rincewind's arrival in Fourecks has distorted the space-time continuum, and he has to sort it out before the whole place dries up and blows away. The situation is complicated because the actual problem is located 30,000 years in the past--just where the Faculty of the Unseen University currently are. Pretty frightening, given "the true wizard's instinct to amble aimlessly into dangerous places," and then "stop and argue ... about exactly what kind of danger it [is]."<p> If you're baffled by all this, no worries, mate. You needn't have read Pratchett before--not even the five previous Discworld novels starring Rincewind (<i>The Colour of Magic</i>, <i>The Light Fantastic</i>, <i>Sourcery</i>, <i>Eric</i>, and <i>Interesting Times</i>)--to enjoy this latest romp. Nor to have visited Australia. When you finish, however, you'll likely want to rush out and do both. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>Terry Pratchett is one of the most popular authors writing today.

A page-turner that can hold its own with any one of the many murder-minded podcasts out there."<br>&#x2014;Jezebel<br><br>From the acclaimed biographer--the fascinating, little-known story of a Victorian-era murder that rocked literary London, leading Charles Dickens, William Thackeray, and Queen Victoria herself to wonder: Can a novel kill?</b><br><br>In May 1840, Lord William Russell, well known in London's highest social circles, was found with his throat cut. The brutal murder had the whole city talking. The police suspected Russell's valet, Courvoisier, but the evidence was weak. The missing clue, it turned out, lay in the unlikeliest place: what Courvoisier had been reading. In the years just before the murder, new printing methods had made books cheap and abundant, the novel form was on the rise, and suddenly everyone was reading. The best-selling titles were the most sensational true-crime stories. Even Dickens and Thackeray, both at the beginning of their careers, fell under the spell of these tales--Dickens publicly admiring them, Thackeray rejecting them. One such phenomenon was William Harrison Ainsworth's <i>Jack Sheppard</i>, the story of an unrepentant criminal who escaped the gallows time and again. When Lord William's murderer finally confessed his guilt, he would cite this novel in his defense. <i>Murder By the Book</i> combines this thrilling true-crime story with an illuminating account of the rise of the novel form and the battle for its early soul among the most famous writers of the time. It is superbly researched, vividly written, and captivating from first to last.</p><p>CLAIRE HARMAN is the author of <i>Charlotte Bront�: A Fiery Heart</i>; <i>Sylvia Townsend Warner</i>, for which she won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize; biographies of Fanny Burney and Robert Louis Stevenson; and <i>Jane's Fame: How Jane Austen Conquered the World</i>.

Fetch a surgeon, fetch a constable, she cried; her master, Lord William Russell, was lying in bed with his throat cut.<br><br>It was thought at first to be a suicide; that is what the young Queen was told at noon, but later that day when her Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord John Russell, arrived at the Palace it was with the melancholy news that his uncle had in fact been murdered, his throat cut so deeply that the windpipe was sliced right through and the head almost severed. The motive appeared to be robbery, as the drawing room of Lord William&#x2019;s house had been turned upside down and a pile of valuables had been discovered near the front door. But the brutality of the crime was what struck the 21-year old monarch: &#x2018;This is really too horrid&#x2019; she wrote in her diary; &#x2018;It is almost an unparalleled thing for a person of Ld William&#x2019;s rank, to be killed like that&#x2019;.&nbsp; <br><br>Lord William&#x2019;s rank did indeed make him a notable corpse, however quiet and unobjectionable a live man he had been. Third and youngest son of the Marquess of Tavistock, he had passed the thirty years since the death of his wife mostly in travel and connoisseurship. He was known at Gore House, Holland House, the Royal Academy and at the Palace itself, but his status and means were nothing to those of his nephew Francis, the seventh Duke of Bedford (owner of Woburn Abbey and its priceless art collection), nor of his nephew Lord John Russell, who was one of the most influential politicians in the land. The house in Norfolk Street where he lived alone was modest by Mayfair standards and Lord William kept only three servants, a maid, a cook and a valet.&nbsp; Two other employees, a coachman and groom, lived off the premises.<br><br>Who would want to butcher in his sleep this unobtrusive minor aristocrat, with his afternoons at Brooks&#x2019;s and his restrained widower habits?&nbsp; In the newspaper articles that were about to appear, no one could find much to say about Lord William&#x2019;s &#x2018;placid and benignant&#x2019; life and &#x2018;unoffending days&#x2019; as a continental traveller and absentee M.P. &#x2018;Aged and respected&#x2019; he was called in the <i>Times</i>, like a cheese.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>But as details emerged of the murder and the bungled burglary that seemed to have provoked it, fears grew that they might be symptoms of something more widespread and insidious. If such a person as Lord William was not safe in his bed, who could be? Such was the panic provoked by the crime, one newspaper declared, that &#x2018;many families at the west-end, and more particularly aged persons living as the deceased had done in comparative retirement, entertain, perhaps for the first time, a feeling of insecurity&#x2019;. <br><br>These were indeed nervous times for the ruling classes. London in 1840 was teeming with immigrants, the unemployed and a burgeoning working class who were more literate and organised than ever before. The winter just past had been one of mass rallies by Chartists demanding universal suffrage that in some places had turned into bloody riots and Lord Brougham had warned at the opening of Parliament in January that the country might in fact be on the brink of revolution, so marked was the change taking place in the disposition of the common people towards &#x2018;all men in power&#x2019;. When over two hundred Chartist demonstrators were arrested and twenty one found guilty of high treason after the uprising in Newport on 4 November 1839, the ancient and barbarous punishment of death by being hung, drawn and quartered seemed suitable to make an example of those convicted.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Was Lord William Russell&#x2019;s murder informed by the same &#x2018;spirit of insubordination&#x2019;, some people wondered? Class boundaries were changing rapidly; had he been chosen as a victim for what he represented as much as what he owned? <br><br>The crime soon had all London talking, from the thieves&#x2019; dens of Soho to Buckingham Palace itself, and for the first time, perhaps, politicians weren&#x2019;t the only people being blamed for rousing up a volatile underclass. As the investigation into Lord William Russell&#x2019;s death proceeded, several of the leading writers of the day were alarmed to find themselves suddenly under fire for having written fictions that were simply too popular and too convincing. Given the chance to mould the taste of a mass audience, many of them were now accused of pandering to the lowest, with books full of violent excitements and vulgarity, that could all too easily lead susceptible readers astray.<br><br>But to understand how the gory events in Norfolk Street were linked to this panic about &#x2018;low&#x2019; culture, and one bestselling book in particular, we need to go back to the evening of Lord William&#x2019;s murder and follow his movements on his last day alive.</p><h2>Below Stairs: The Bestselling Memoirs of a 1920&#39;s Kitchen Maid</h2><p>Arriving at the great houses of 1920s London, fifteen-year-old Margaret&#39;s life in service was about to begin As a kitchen maid the lowest of the low she entered an entirely new world; one of stoves to be blacked, vegetables to be scrubbed, mistresses to be appeased, and even bootlaces to be ironed. Work started at 5.30am and went on until after dark. It was a far cry from her childhood on the beaches of Hove, where money and food were scarce, but warmth and laughter never were. Yet from the gentleman with a penchant for stroking the housemaids&#39; curlers, to raucous tea-dances with errand boys, to the heartbreaking story of Agnes the pregnant under-parlourmaid, fired for being seduced by her mistress&#39;s nephew, Margaret&#39;s tales of her time in service are told with wit, warmth, and a sharp eye for the prejudices of her situation. Brilliantly evoking the long-vanished world of masters and servants, Below Stairs is the remarkable true story of an indomitable woman, who, though her position was lowly, never stopped aiming high. &#39;Enormous gusto, salty humour, wisdom&#39; Evening Standard &#39;Shrewd, unabashed, wickedly funny, a unique front-line report of her life&#39;s experiences&#39; Jack De Manio, BBC</p><p>Margaret Powell was born in 1907 in Hove. Aged fifteen, she went into service as a kitchen maid, eventually progressing to the position of cook. In 1968 the first volume of her memoirs, Below Stairs, was published to instant success. She died in 1984.<b>1</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I WAS BORN in 1907 in Hove, the second child of a family of seven. My earliest recollection is that other children seemed to be better off than we were. But our parents cared so much for us. One particular thing that I always remember was that every Sunday morning my father used to bring us a comic and a bag of sweets. You used to be able to get a comic for a halfpenny plain and a penny coloured. Sometimes now when I look back at it, I wonder how he managed to do it when he was out of work and there was no money at all coming in.<br>My father was a painter and decorator. Sort of general odd-job man. He could do almost anything: repair roofs, or do a bit of plastering; but painting and paper-hanging were his main work. Yet in the neighbourhood where we lived, there was hardly any work in the winter. People didn&#x2019;t want their houses done up then; they couldn&#x2019;t be painted outside and they didn&#x2019;t want the bother of having it all done up inside. So the winters were the hardest times.<br>My mother used to go out charring from about eight in the morning till six in the evening for two shillings a day. Sometimes she used to bring home little treasures: a basin of dripping, half a loaf of bread, a little bit of butter or a bowl of soup. She used to hate accepting anything. She hated charity. But we were so glad of them that, when she came home and we saw that she was carrying something, we used to make a dive to see what she&#x2019;d got.<br>It seems funny today, I suppose, that there was this hatred of charity, but when my parents brought us up there was no unemployment money. Anything you got was a charity.<br>I remember my mother, when we only had one pair of shoes each and they all needed mending, she went down to the council to try to get more for us. She had to answer every question under the sun and she was made to feel that there was something distasteful about her because she hadn&#x2019;t got enough money to live on.<br>It was very different getting somewhere to live in those days. You just walked through the streets, and there were notices up, &#x2018;Rooms to let&#x2019;. When we were extra hard up, we only had one room or two rooms in somebody else&#x2019;s house. But when Dad was working, we would go around looking for half a house. We never had a house to ourselves. Not many people could afford a house in those days, not to themselves. As for buying a house, why, such things were never even dreamed of !<br>I know I used to wonder why, when things were so hard, Mum kept having babies, and I remember how angry she used to get when a couple of elderly spinsters at a house where she worked kept telling her not to have any more children, that she couldn&#x2019;t afford to keep them. I remember saying to my mother, &#x2018;Why do you have so many children? Is it hard to have children?&#x2019; And she said, &#x2018;Oh, no. It&#x2019;s as easy as falling off a log.&#x2019;<br>You see that was the only pleasure poor people could afford. It cost nothing &#x2013; at least at the time when you were actually making the children. The fact that it would cost you something later on, well, the working-class people never looked ahead in those days. They didn&#x2019;t dare. It was enough to live for the present.<br>People didn&#x2019;t think about regulating families. The whole idea was to have big families, a relic of Victorian times perhaps. The more children you had, in some ways, the more you were looked upon as fulfilling your duties as a Christian citizen. Not that the Church played much part in my mother&#x2019;s and father&#x2019;s lives. I don&#x2019;t think they had much time for it or, perhaps it&#x2019;s truer to say, they had time but no inclination. Some of us weren&#x2019;t even christened. I wasn&#x2019;t, and never have been. But we all had to go to Sunday School, not because my parents were religious, but because it kept us out of the way: Sunday afternoons were devoted to lovemaking because there was not much privacy in working-class families. When you lived in two or three rooms, you had to have some of the children in the same room with you. If you had any sense of decency, and my parents did because I never, during the whole time of my childhood, knew that they ever made love, you waited till they were fast asleep or out of the way. The fact is I never even saw them kissing each other because my father was a rather austere man outwardly, and I was amazed when only lately my mother told me what a passionate man he really was. So, you see, it was only when the children were out of the way that they could really let themselves go. So, Sunday afternoon, after a mighty big dinner (and everybody tried to have a big dinner on Sunday), was the time spent lying on the bed, making love and having a good old doze. Because, as my Mum said later, if you make love, you might as well do it in comfort. So that&#x2019;s why Sunday School was so popular then.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>My early school days don&#x2019;t stand out much in my mind. My brother and I began proper school together. They let you start at the age of four in those days. My mother sent me there as well because she had another baby coming along and she thought that would be two of us out of the way.<br>We had to come home for dinner. There were no such things as school meals and school milk. You took a piece of bread and butter with you, wrapped in a piece of paper, and gave it to the teacher to mind, because many of us children were so hungry that we used to nibble it during the course of the morning when we should have been doing whatever we did have to do. It was then doled out to us at eleven o&#x2019;clock.<br>I always enjoyed going to school because I did pretty well there. I never found any of it hard except things like art, knitting, and needlework. Singing was hopeless, too. None of those things were any good to me at all. The needlework was my biggest hate. We had to make such ugly garments; chemises and bloomers &#x2013; as they were called then. Both made of calico. The chemises were wide with sort of cap sleeves and they reached down to the knees. The bloomers did up at the back with buttons and were also voluminous. Whoever bought these awful garments when they were finished I really don&#x2019;t know. I should imagine they were given to the workhouse because I certainly never brought any home.<br>But the great thing about school in those days was that we had to learn. I don&#x2019;t think you can beat learning; how to read and write, and how to do arithmetic. Those are the three things that anyone who has got to work for a living needs. We were forced to learn and I think children need to be forced. I don&#x2019;t believe in this business of &#x2018;if they don&#x2019;t want to do it, it won&#x2019;t do them any good&#x2019;. It <i>will</i> do them good. Our teacher used to come around and give us a mighty clump on the neck or box on the ears if she saw us wasting our time. Believe me, by the time we came out of school, we came out with something. We knew enough to get us through life. Not that any of us thought about what we were going to do. We all knew that when we left school we&#x2019;d have to do something, but I don&#x2019;t think we had any ambitions to do any particular type of work.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>It was when I got to the age of about seven that I, as it were, took my place in life. You see, with my mother going off early in the morning to do her charring and me being the eldest girl, I used to have to give the children their breakfast. Mind you, giving them their breakfast wasn&#x2019;t a matter of cooking anything. We never had eggs or bacon, and things like cereals weren&#x2019;t heard of. We had porridge in the winter, and just bread and margarine, and a scraping of jam, if Mum had any, in the summer. Three pieces were all we were allowed. Then I would make the tea, very weak tea known as sweepings &#x2013; the cheapest that there was &#x2013; clear away and wash up, and then get ready for school.<br>The two youngest I took along to the day nursery. It cost sixpence a day each and for that the children got a midday meal as well. I took them just before school time and collected them the moment I came out of school in the afternoon.<br>At midday, I would run home, get the potatoes and the greens on, lay up the dinner and do everything I could so that when my mother rushed over from work, she just had to serve the dinner.<br>Generally it was stews because they were the most filling. Sometimes Mother would make a meat pudding. It&#x2019;s funny now when I look back on it, this meat pudding. I would go along to the butcher&#x2019;s and ask for sixpennyworth of &#x2018;Block ornaments&#x2019;. Hygiene was nothing like it is now and butchers used to have big wooden slabs outside the shop with all the meat displayed for the public and the flies. As they cut up the joints, they always had odd lumps of meat left which they scattered around. These were known as &#x2018;Block ornaments&#x2019;. I used to get sixpennyworth of them and a pennyworth of suet. Then my mother would make the most marvellous meat pudding with it.<br>Directly after she&#x2019;d eaten her dinner, she&#x2019;d have to rush back to work because she was only allowed half an hour. So I had to do the washing-up before I went back to school again. Right after I came out of school in the afternoon, I would collect the two children from the day nursery, take them back home, and then set to and clear up the place and make the beds.<br>I never used to feel that I was suffering in any sense from ill-usage. It was just the thing. When you were the eldest girl in a working-class family, it was expected of you.<br>Of course, Mum took over in the evenings. She came back about six and got us our tea which was the same as breakfast &#x2013; bread and margarine.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Unlike so many people I&#x2019;ve met, I didn&#x2019;t really make any lasting friends in my school days. But, being a member of a family, I wasn&#x2019;t worried and, you see, we had the town itself.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 1968 by...</p><h2>Gate 7, Vol. 3</h2><p>A battle for supernatural supremacy rages in Kyoto!

A Place on Earth resonates with variations played on themes of change; looping transitions from war into peace, winter into spring, browning flood destruction into greening fields, absence into presence, lost into found. This brings the revised 1983 edition back into print, the next book in our program to put all of Wendell Berry&#39;s fiction into print in revised and corrected uniform editions.</p><p>Berrys themes are reflections of his life: friends, family, the farm, the nature around us as well as within. He speaks strongly for himself and sometimes for the lost heart of the country. As he has borne witness to the world for eight decades, what he offers us now in this new collection of poems is of incomparable value.The titular place on earth is the rural community of Port William, Kentucky, where family sticks together and neighbors lend a hand. Paul Michael gives voice to Berry�s beautiful prose, carrying the listener through life�s cycle of birth and death as complicated by the events of WWII. Central is Matt�s struggle to cope with his son, Virgil�s, status as missing in action, a piece of news that arrives shortly before Virgil�s daughter�s birth. Ultimately, Matt�s sense of place brings him serenity. Michael�s subtle characterizations offer emotion and levity in just the right doses. He applies sweet Southern accents just as easily as he tosses out amusing colloquialisms. Don�t miss his depiction of Port William�s celebration of the end of the war.

She half-opened her eyes, stretched her arms above her head, and then, catching sight of a large sign tied to the foot of her bed, yelled out, &#x201c;Rabbit! Rabbit!&#x201d; She bounced out of bed and ran out of her room and down the hall.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve finally done it!&#x201d; she cried as she dashed into the large bedroom shared by two of her three brothers.<br><br>The oldest, Brian, responded by drawing the covers tightly over his head and turning thumpily toward the wall, but Mart, her almost-twin, sat up excitedly and demanded to know what she had done to cause all this rumpus at eight o&#x2019;clock in the morning&#x2013;enough rumpus, in fact, to wake up Bobby, who at this moment appeared in the doorway.<br><br>Trixie&#x2019;s blue eyes were sparkling as she picked up her youngest brother and twirled him round and round. Then, plunking herself down on Brian&#x2019;s bed, she said, &#x201c;Well, ever since I was Bobby&#x2019;s age I&#x2019;ve been trying to remember to say &#x2018;Rabbit!

Is it sumpin&#x2019; like measles or chicken pox?&#x201d; Bobby asked, his eyes wide as he scrambled up on the bed beside his sister. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want Trixie to die,&#x201d; he cried. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s the only sister I got.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course she&#x2019;s not going to die,&#x201d; Brian assured him softly. &#x201c; &#x2018;Ennui&#x2019; is just a fancy way of saying you&#x2019;re tired of doing the same old thing all the time.&#x201d;<br><br>The tears dried magically, a smile broke over Bobby&#x2019;s face, and he said, &#x201c;Oh! That&#x2019;s what I get every morning when I have to eat my cereal!&#x201d;<br><br>The call of &#x201c;Breakfast, children&#x201d; interrupted their laughter, and they dashed downstairs in their pajamas to the large, friendly kitchen where Mrs. Belden was frying bacon and eggs on the old-fashioned stove.<br><br>Their father, who worked in the Sleepyside bank, put aside his paper as they came in and, looking over the top of his glasses, greeted each of them. Trixie planted a quick kiss on top of his head as she went past him to her place at the table.<br><br>The Beldens lived in a comfortable old white farmhouse, a few miles outside the Hudson River town of Sleepyside. It was called Crabapple Farm and had been in the Belden family for six generations. Although larger and grander houses had been built around the ancient homestead over the years, they loved Crabapple Farm with its orchards and gardens. Mrs. Belden never found it a chore to care for and harvest the fruits and vegetables the place yielded, and in the fall, her pantry shelves were loaded with preserves, pickles, and jellies. Even though the boys sometimes grumbled about having to take care of the chickens, they freely admitted that the Belden eggs were the biggest and best they had ever seen. Trixie, who hated housework, sometimes complained, too, about having to help with the dishes or the dusting, but once when her mother, pretending to be serious, suggested they sell the house and move to an apartment where the housekeeping might be a little easier, Trixie nearly exploded. It was quite a long time after that before she was heard to say, &#x201c;Do I <i>have </i>to? You mean right <i>now?&#x201d;<br><br></i>Trixie&#x2019;s best friends, Honey Wheeler and her adopted brother, Jim, lived a little farther up Glen Road in an impressive mansion on a huge estate. The fact that the Wheelers&#x2019; wealth allowed them a staff of servants and every luxury never interfered with their close<br>friendship. Honey and Trixie had met soon after Mr. Wheeler had bought the Manor House, with its stable of horses, game preserve, and swimming pool, hoping it would benefit his somewhat sickly daughter. Honey&#x2019;s real name was Madeleine, but no one ever called her that now, and no one seemed to remember who first gave her the nickname. Everyone agreed, however, that it suited her perfectly, for Honey was always as cheerful and sweet as she was pretty.<br>After the two girls became friends, Honey somehow forgot her ill health. There just wasn&#x2019;t time to be sick with all they found to do. Their first adventure had been helping Jim Frayne, a wonderful boy, who was running away from a cruel stepfather. It had ended by Jim&#x2019;s inheriting a half-million dollars from an uncle, his only relative, and being adopted by Mr. Wheeler.<br>&#x201c;What are you all going to do this rainy day?&#x201d; Mr. Belden inquired as he put on his raincoat and prepared to leave for work.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you worry about them not having anything to do,&#x201d; Mrs. Belden answered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been waiting for just such a day as this to clean out the attic and the top of the barn.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Moms! Not again,&#x201d; groaned Brian. &#x201c;Why, we just cleaned the barn&#x2013;let&#x2019;s see, when was it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Tempus fugit, </i>dear brother,&#x201d; Mart said cheerily. &#x201c;It was at least four years ago, because I remember what a fuss I made when Moms wanted to throw out my magnificent collection of rocks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Will it take all day?&#x201d; Trixie asked a bit impatiently. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re supposed to have a meeting of the Bob-Whites this afternoon up at the clubhouse. The president of the Heart Association wrote and asked if we&#x2019;d help with their White Elephant Sale, and we have to talk it over and see what we can do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s a coincidence,&#x201d; Mrs. Belden said, &#x201c;because I thought if we cleaned out the attic and barn we might find some things to donate to the sale.&#x201d;<br><br>Trixie was suddenly all smiles. &#x201c;Gleeps, Moms,&#x201d; she cried, &#x201c;what a perfectly spiffy idea! You can count on <i>all </i>the Bob-Whites to help!&#x201d;<br><br>The Bob-Whites of the Glen was a secret club which Jim had organized soon after he came to live with the Wheelers. Although they were forever getting involved in some mystery, they also found time to be of help to others. There were now seven regular members in the club&#x2013;the three Beldens, Honey and Jim, Dan Mangan, and Diana Lynch. Dan&#x2019;s part-time jobs and a heavy school program prevented him from joining in all of the Bob-Whites&#x2019; adventures, but he was with the club whenever he could be. Di, as she was called, lived close by in another large house. Her twin brothers and sisters were much younger than she, so she welcomed membership in the club because it gave her a chance to be with people her own age. Di had always been considered the prettiest girl in the group, with her shoulder-length black hair, fair skin, and large violet eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll phone Honey and Di and tell them to check what they can collect at their houses and then we&#x2019;ll all meet late this afternoon to see what needs mending or repairing,&#x201d; Trixie said, her enthusiasm for the project growing all the time.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on, Mart,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;you and Brian get dressed and do the barn, and Moms and I will tackle the attic.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was planning to fix the muffler on my car,&#x201d; Brian said. He was always fussing with his old jalopy, usually quite successfully, because he was a superb mechanic. &#x201c;But the co-president of the Bob-Whites is issuing orders, so I guess the Queen of the Highways will have to wait. All set, Mart?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All set,&#x201d; Mart growled, &#x201c;but let me tell you, Trixie Belden, one day is all I&#x2019;m going to give up for any elephant, white or purple. So don&#x2019;t try to inveigle me into working all week on some old wrecked piece of furniture or something.&#x201d;<br><br>Mart and Trixie frequently appeared to be in some kind of feud, but underneath they were very fond of each other. Their birthdays were less than a year apart, and although Mart was taller than Trixie, they looked enough alike to be twins.<br><br>Trixie met her brother&#x2019;s statement with a chilly silence as she went off to telephone.<br><br>&#x201c;This promises to be a productive day,&#x201d; Mrs. Belden commented as she walked with her husband to the door and bade him good-by. She didn&#x2019;t know, as she said it, just <i>how </i>productive it would turn out to be. She gathered up several cartons from the porch and headed for the back stairs that led to the attic. She was soon joined by Trixie and Bobby who volunteered, &#x201c;I wanna hunt for the elephant, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where do you want me to start?&#x201d; ...</p><h2>The Ultimate Dolls&#39; House Book : A Charming Book About the Most Famous Small-Scale Wonders</h2><p>Hardcover book filled with color photos by Matthew Ward.

It was a health food restaurant&#x2014; still a new concept then&#x2014; on Hampstead High Street. Only posh Hampstead would have such a shop. There wasn&#x2019;t much wheatgrass or braised tofu in Sunderland.</p><p>So we drove there, but we didn&#x2019;t actually go in. We could see her through the window and we waited outside. I started steaming up the window from the outside with my breath, and I began drawing on the window&#x2019;s condensation. I wrote, in reverse so she could read, &#x201c;Will you marry me?&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t really see her that properly because it was this packed little place. As usual I looked quirky and odd, wearing Kellogg&#x2019;s Frosted Flakes &#x201c;Tony the Tiger&#x201d; sunglasses and cropped spiky hair. We could see the manager of the restaurant mouthing to Annie, &#x201c;Do you know these people?&#x201d;</p><p>Paul knew what time she was finished&#x2014; seven o&#x2019;clock&#x2014; so we waited till she came out. When she did, she was a bit annoyed and worried she could lose her job. But we started talking, and we connected straightaway. Paul wanted to go to a bar called the Speakeasy, so Annie and I went with him, and we carried on talking. We were in this place for about ten minutes when we both said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t really like this place. Where should we go?&#x201d;</p><p>We went back to her tiny bedsit room in Camden Town, with just enough room for a little bed and her old wooden harmonium, and started talking. Annie and I basically didn&#x2019;t stop talking for the next twenty years.</p><p>She had longish hair, not blond or dark, but brownish, and a secondhand fake fur coat she wore over an old-fashioned print dress. She looked very studentlike, and she really was&#x2014; a student living on hardly anything. But she had incredibly stunning, piercing blue eyes and the most beautiful face I&#x2019;d ever seen. I could tell she was very sensitively alert to everything, like a real artist.</p><p>She played a couple of her songs on her harmonium. One was called &#x201c;Tower of Capricorn,&#x201d; and there was another one called &#x201c;Song for Matt,&#x201d; about a boyfriend she&#x2019;d had who had died rather tragically. She sang, &#x201c;Matt I got your letter, on the thin blue paper/ the kind that come from long distances . . .&#x201d;</p><p>I was utterly knocked out by everything about her: her singing, the chords she was playing, her delicate words and her haunting beauty.</p><p>Her singing and her songs reminded me of Joni Mitchell. I&#x2019;d been big Joni fan, especially the album <i>Blue</i>. This reminded me a little bit of that, except the instrumentation was different, because Joni was playing dulcimers and guitars. But Annie was singing while playing this big old harmonium. Pam told me just before we parted that she knew I was going to be with someone more like a Joni Mitchell type, an artist who could sing and play. Annie was all this and more. I had found my soul mate, and I knew it with absolute certainty.</p><p>It was 1975. We stayed together that night and every single night after that for the next five years and to this day are still best friends.</p><p>I immediately thought, &#x201c;Well, this girl is incredibly talented.&#x201d; And she kept saying, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if anybody will like these songs.&#x201d;</p><p>I said, &#x201c;Are you joking? I&#x2019;m telling you. You&#x2019;re a phenomenal songwriter.&#x201d;</p><p>From the first day, I told her she was an artist, and I think that meant a lot to her. Until then, she&#x2019;d been torn about sticking in at the Royal Academy of Music. She had been studying flute and harpsichord, but she didn&#x2019;t like it because the place was very stiff, and everything was too competitive. Everyone there was practicing all the time, practicing to be the best violinist or the best flute player. And she was more excited about Joni Mitchell or Stevie Wonder, which was at odds with this formal, traditional, classically oriented world where she was studying.</p><p>She had no money and was starting to do tiny gigs with a friend, doing cover versions of Elton John songs and others to make some cash, in addition to working in this vegetarian restaurant. So when I said she was an artist, it was very affirming to her. And from the minute we met, I never saw her go to college again. And from that moment on, we were together. We didn&#x2019;t leave each other&#x2019;s side; we went everywhere together.</p><p>The next morning Annie told me she suffered from panic attacks, and she was feeling very anxious a lot of the time. I felt really bad for her, so I said, &#x201c;Well, look, I tell you what. Why don&#x2019;t we go and chat to my mom, who lives in this tiny room in Crouch End?&#x201d; She agreed and we took the double-decker bus. Halfway there, she was panicking, going, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Don&#x2019;t really know you very well, and I don&#x2019;t know your mom, and I don&#x2019;t know why we&#x2019;re even on this bus.&#x201d;</p><p>I tried to reassure her by saying my mum had been through all this stuff and she knew about these kinds of things.</p><p>When we got there, Annie felt more relaxed, and my mom was very sweet, but she was packing to go on holiday for a few weeks. She said we could have the flat key and stay while she was gone.</p><p>So we moved in that night. But Annie didn&#x2019;t realize I was a drug addict, addicted to speed. That first night I went out to get some bread and milk and didn&#x2019;t come back. She was in my mom&#x2019;s flat on her own, not knowing really where she was or what was going on. I didn&#x2019;t come back until six o&#x2019;clock in the morning, telling her excited stories about Piccadilly and some girl called Circles. I must have seemed really bonkers, but I was so used to this crazy lifestyle of staying up all night. I was being really honest. I would tell her everything. I was always meeting and talking to twenty different people in a day, and I think Annie slowly caught on; she knew something wasn&#x2019;t right. I felt very natural around Annie and she did around me, so I told her about my drug taking.</p><p>I was falling madly in love, and I told her so. We then decided we were going to live together. This must have been only three or four days into our relationship, but there was no denying it. But we couldn&#x2019;t live together in my mom&#x2019;s flat and we couldn&#x2019;t live in Annie&#x2019;s little room, which was only big enough to have the harmonium, a single bed, a tiny sink and a kettle. So we went to talk to Paul, who had the shop and the three floors above, which were part of the squat, and he was going to live up there. But there were other rooms in the house, and he had already said to Annie that she could have one of the rooms. So she went to see him and said, &#x201c;Hey, do you mind if Dave and I both move in?&#x201d; He thought about it for a second and agreed.</p><p>Of course, there was nothing in there. It was just a derelict empty house with no furniture and rubble everywhere. Nothing worked. You had to climb over bricks and debris to get to brush your teeth. When people talk about starting from scratch, it means from zero, right? Well, this, literally, was where we were: at zero. No money, no carpet, no bed, no nothing; just the idea that we would live together in this run-down house.</p><p>Normally when you meet somebody you fall in love with, you go through tentative stages. There was none of that with us. It was like I didn&#x2019;t know her one minute, and the next minute we were living together. We were never apart. It wasn&#x2019;t like we would see each other occasionally. We were together. Inseparable.</p><p>We lived there for at least two years. And eventually, we made it better and better. We got rid of the bricks. Luxury!</p><p>Paul was quite amazing, and he just seemed to understand that we got on like a house on fire, like two musicians in love. Paul was a really funny guy, a mensch really, but he was also kind of crazy. If we complained that it was freezing, he would simply say okay and chop up the kitchen cabinet and throw it on the fire. He was thinking that it was just a squat anyway. But Annie and I were trying to make it into a little home.</p><p>We went shopping in jumble sales and junkyards, looking for plates and cups for a few pennies, or a sofa that we bought for one pound. Annie was such fun to be around when it was just the two of us. We were always laughing and talking constantly, chatting about our lives and what had happened to us up to that point. After a month I knew everything about Annie and she knew everything about me. Every painful thing that we had experienced we found easy to talk about with each other, and we shared the same surreal sense of humor that sometimes only the two of us could get. We never played music together, didn&#x2019;t even talk about it that much.</p><p>One simple thing that Annie decided to do saved my life. Instead of being confrontational about my addiction to speed and cocaine, she just asked me one day how much I took. She had a little notebook, and she wanted to know how many lines of speed or coke I took over twenty-four hours, and she said she would write it down. Then she showed me and suggested that I try to cut down from, say, twenty times to nineteen, then to eighteen and so on.</p><p>She started making healthy food. At the time I had a twenty-four-inch waist and ate hardly anything, because you don&#x2019;t feel hungry when you are speeding away all the time. The combination of cutting down on drugs very slowly, tapering off them, mixed with eating small amounts of real homemade food and living with someone who loved me enough to care for me in such a delicate way helped me eventually quit drugs altogether. It wasn&#x2019;t easy, though, and it took a very long time to get totally clean. But she never left me during this period. While I was trying to detox, Annie would have to put up with dealers coming around the house at all hours, one time even being woken up in our bedroom by Blue, the Hell&#x2019;s Angel, trying to give me coke on the end of a flick knife while I was still asleep. Annie shouted for him to get out, and she has a very loud voice!</p><p>So our lives together were a mixture of very extreme situations with many oddball characters popping in and out, but then, when we were left alone, we were incredibly sweet to each other and loved to do simple things. It was an amazing time to be young and in love. There was a wild energy in the air. Margaret Thatcher had become the first female leader of the Conservative Party, white nationalist groups, such as the National Front, were becoming more outspoken, and there was racial conflict in the air. Bands like the Sex Pistols and Sham 69 formed, and people were out in the street drunk and shouting outside our window like there was a riot about to happen most nights.</p><p>In the record store below us, Paul was blasting out either punk or heavy reggae/ dub music, and our floor was constantly shaking with the bass throbbing through the house. Sometimes it was so loud that we couldn&#x2019;t think straight, so we would have to go for a walk or go visit someone. We didn&#x2019;t really know many people as a couple, and for some reason we were quite shy about getting to know new people. But eventually we had a small circle of friends who were mainly people I knew, artists I&#x2019;d met who Annie could relate to. As we rarely had any money, we stayed mainly within walking distance of the squat. The first time I took Annie to the Railway Tavern up the road, she was shocked, as the landlord immediately kicked us out, saying I was banned. The same thing happened when we walked down to the Queens, another pub in Crouch End. I had to explain that I had been dragged out and down to the police station from both places in the past for &#x201c;causing a disturbance&#x201d; along with Barry Dransfield. Annie took all of this rather well and just adapted to each situation as it came. I knew she always had my back and I had hers; our bond became stronger and stronger.</p><p>I decided to introduce Annie to my friend Peet Coombes. Peet was my good friend, and a great songwriter I hung out with a lot. Because I&#x2019;d fallen so madly in love, I hadn&#x2019;t even seen him for a month or two. One day he came around to visit us, and he brought his guitar. He played some new songs around the kitchen table, and they were all great. One was called &#x201c;Just the Wind&#x201d; and another &#x201c;Dot.&#x201d; Annie joined in singing harmonies immediately, and it was as if they had sung together for years, their voices blended so well together. We discussed right then and there the idea of forming a band around the three of us, which would eventually become the Tourists.</p><br><br><p>Now we were three, and we were a band. Peet was very much the leader&#x2014; the songwriter and lead singer. Annie played keyboards and sang harmonies mostly. A lot of the time we&#x2019;d have the lead voice and harmony together all the way through. I played rhythm guitar and lead guitar.</p><p>I&#x2019;d met a guy called Rob Gold a while back at Island Music, and he paid for us to record some demos for Logo Songs, a small publishing company he was now working with. I had no ambition whatsoever then about being a songwriter myself. I was always the fan of Peet&#x2019;s and now Annie&#x2019;s songs, so when it came to recording the demos, I didn&#x2019;t do much apart from being enthusiastic and playing guitar a bit on a couple of Peet&#x2019;s songs. Annie sang her songs and played harmonium or piano. The demos were good.</p><p>Rob was impressed, but not quite sure how this raggle-taggle bunch would fit together. We didn&#x2019;t really know yet either. At first we called ourselves the Catch, and we soon got signed to a publishing deal with Logo Songs and a record deal with Logo Records. I remember when we were sitting in their offices and they started talking about advances, paying us money for signing the contracts, and Annie said, &#x201c;Oh no, you don&#x2019;t have to pay us.&#x201d;</p><p>I was standing on her foot under the table, as I&#x2019;d had a publishing deal and a record deal before and knew they needed to give us an advance. Besides, we were completely penniless, broke and living in a squat at the time. Annie and I had no idea yet of the power that we were going to have as a duo in Eurythmics, so we were happy to have any kind of recognition, and a record deal was not an easy thing to get back then. I was happy for Peet to be the songwriter, as he was very talented, and Annie seemed fine about that too.</p><p>At first the label obviously thought Annie was a really great singer and a great-looking girl, so what was she doing with these two drug fiends? To make our record, they put us in the studio with session musicians. We&#x2019;d never heard of having session musicians. I&#x2019;d always had a band, and Peet had always had a band or played his own material. We were confused, as we played our own music the way we thought it should sound! Everything was taken out of our hands, and the session players played our music their way.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the record didn&#x2019;t sound anything like how we wanted it to. It had lead vocals by Annie and harmonies by Peet. But that was where it stopped. It didn&#x2019;t resemble anything like the quirky sound the three of us made or even how Annie did as herself. But the production was all wrong; the session players made it sound dated and bland. We didn&#x2019;t understand why they were doing this, but we went along with it.</p><p>We stopped recording for a while, stunned at what had happened, but we had a tiny amount of money from the advance, so Annie and I bought the cheapest little Morris Minor van for about two hundred pounds. It was a real bone shaker.

British historian Costello provides a fascinating, massively researched portrait of the Soviet moles. His conclusions must be viewed cautiously, however, since most British secrets are still classified and since "a wilderness of mirrors" confronts anyone attempting to undo these labyrinths. More sweeping in his conclusions than Peter Wright's Spycatcher (Viking, 1987; see The Spycatcher Affair, below), Costello sees Blunt as the "first man" in the Cambridge ring, and the highly placed Guy Laddelle as the Soviet's "grandfather mole." Heavy going for the general reader, but sure to be much discussed. Recommended. Gregor A.

She does so with the kind of open-eyed reality that makes this book of cartoons read like a how-to manual, or at the very least, a view of what new parents can expect. Chast's sense of humor is apparent in her popular cartoon, "Bad Mom Cards": a series of mug shots of moms gone wrong, like the mom who "ran out of orange juice and served kids orange soda instead." The book's nice design and handsome size make for a great gift.</p><h2>Long Time No See: A Novel</h2><p><p><em>"On an unseasonably warm Halloween night, while I was reading a snappy treatise on Wendell Wilkie's support of FDR's war policies and handing out the occasional bag of M&amp;M's to a trick-or-treater, the fair-haired and dimpled Courtney Logan, age thirty-four, magna cum laude graduate of Princeton, erstwhile investment banker at Patton Giddings, wife of darkly handsome Greg, mother of five-year-old Travis, canner of spiced pears, collector of vintage petit point, and ex-president of citizens for a more beautiful Shorehaven vanished from long island into thin air."</em></p><p>Judith Singer is back! After twenty years Susan Isaacs brings us back the heroine from <em>Compromising Positions,</em> her first and most beloved novel and returns to a great suspense story set in suburbia. Judith's life has changed. She now has her doctorate in history. Her workaday hours are spent at St. Elizabeth's College, mostly squandered in history department shriek-fests. She is also a widow. Her husband Bob died one half-day after triumphantly finishing the New York City Marathon in four hours and twelve minutes. And although twenty years have passed without seeing him, she still cannot get her former lover, Nelson Sharpe of the Nassau County Police Department, out of her system. </p><p>With Courtney Logan's dramatic disappearance, all eyes turn instantly toward her husband, Greg Logan, son of Long Island mobster Philip "Fancy Phil" Lowenstein. But since there is no body, there is no arrest. Then, in the less-than-merry month of May, Judith comes home from work, turns on the radio, and hears the Logans' pool man telling a reporter that he opened the pool and found . . . a raccoon? Not quite. "I see, you know, it's a body! Jeez. Believe it or not, I'm still shaking." The woman in the pool turns out to be Courtney, and now it's officially homicide. And Judith comes alive! She offers her services to the police's chief suspect, Greg Logan, but he shows her the door, thinking her just another neighborhood nut. But his father isn't so sure: Fancy Phil may have other plans for her. </p><p><em>Long Time No See</em> is Susan Isaacs at her wickedly observant best. With razor-sharp wit and an irresistible mystery, she brings us back in touch with an engaging, endearing and irreverent heroine we haven't seen in far too long. </p></p><p>In Susan Isaac's <i>Long Time No See</i>, Courtney Logan, former investment analyst, devoted mother, and Long Island housewife, leaves her home on Halloween night for a quick trip to the grocery store. Five months later, her badly decomposed body is found floating in the backyard pool, concealed by the pool cover.<p> Enter Judith Singer, who helped find a murderer in Isaac's 1978 bestseller, <i>Compromising Positions</i>. Something about the Logan case doesn't make sense to Judith, and she becomes so engrossed in the mystery that she actually knocks on the grieving husband's door and offers to help exonerate him. <i>Long Time No See</i> draws on the best of the light, character-driven mysteries, like those by Janet Evanovich and Mary Daheim. Isaac's first- person heroine is impulsive enough to get herself into trouble, yet thoughtful enough to invite confidences. And her voice is appealingly funny and honest. "Since becoming a widow," she reflects, when faced with a twist in her investigation, </p><p> </p><blockquote>I'd tried hard not to indulge in the lonely person's Happy Hour: talking to oneself. About a year earlier, in the drugstore, I found myself befuddled, dithering between a condom rack and a display of batteries, and was startled when I heard my own loud voice demanding: 'Why am I here?' But now I gave in and had a chat with me. </blockquote><p> Although clever and well-written, the novel's real strength lies in its characterization and in Isaac's leisurely unfolding of the implausible dark side of the perky blonde murder victim. This is a welcome outing from a deservedly popular writer. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p><p>Susan Isaacs is the bestselling author of eleven novels, two screenplays, and one work of nonfiction.

He bought a Sears Roebuck guitar at the age of 13 and several months later played his first &#34;gig.&#34; (He recalled playing until his fingers were raw!) Mel took up the tenor banjo shortly thereafter and continued to play both instruments. During his teenage years Mel played with a wild assortement of bands and characters in rural Missouri. Perhaps no &#34;gig&#34; was as strange as the job he landed with, in Mel&#39;s words, &#34;a snake oil salesman.&#34; This flamboyant peddler would pull his ostentatious Pierce Arrow automobile, complete with steer horns mounted on the grill, into the center of a small, rural town. Mel would sit on the car and play up a storm on the tenor banjo. After a crowd gathered, the peddler took over and began extolling the merits of his &#34;wonder elixer.&#34; In 1933 Mel Bay moved to St. Louis and began his professional career. He played with numerous local and traveling bands. In addition, he landed staff guitar jobs on several radio stations. Mel fronted his own trio (piano, bass, guitar) and played steadily for 25 years! He was equally adept on most fretted instruments and played mandolin, uke, Hawaiian guitar, tenor and plectrum banjo professionally. While Mel was actively pursuing his playing career, he continued to teach as many as 100 students a week. He decided to begin writing instructional materials due to the difficulty encountered by guitarists at playing good sounding chord forms in rhythm sections and due to the poor note reading ability prevalent among guitarists. After the war Mel was asked to write instructional materials on guitar for GI&#39;s wanting to learn music under the GI Bill. In 1947 Mel formed his own publishing company and wrote his landmark initial book titled The Orchestral Chord System for Guitar. (This book is still in print under the title Rhythm Guitar Chord System and continues to be one the finest rhythm guitar chord texts available!) His Modern Guitar Method was penned shortly thereafter. For years Mel traveled from town to town talking to guitar teachers and players and showing them his publications. At one time Mel claims to have known virtually every guitar teacher in America on a first name basis! The guitar and Mel Bay books caught on in a big way in the 1950&#39;s. Things have continued to grow ever since. Mel used to sell D&#39;Angelico guitars. At any given time he would have 5 or 6 &#34;lying around the house.&#34; Mel played professionally on his New Yorker model but his favorite was the initial Mel Bay Model crafted as a gift for him by John D&#39;Angelico. This famous guitar had all of the main features of the New Yorker but was a &#34;cut away&#34; model and had a slightly thinner neck. This instrument has been pictured on the Mel Bay Modern Guitar Method for decades. Someone once calculated that sales of guitar books written by Mel Bay have exceeded 25 million copies. When asked, Mel frequently said that he quit counting long ago. Sales of his Modern Guitar Method have alone surpassed the 7 million mark. It is safe to say that Mel Bay is one of the pivotal figures in the world of guitar music and instruction in this century.</p><h2>1,000 Things Under the Sea Revised</h2><p>Children need to add lots of words to their spoken vocabulary, and this fantastic look-and-talk book will provide them with plenty of opportunities to do so.

Then a storm exploded on the mountain, ripping the team to shreds, forcing brave men to scratch and crawl for their lives. Rescuers who reached Weathers saw that he was dying, and left him. Twelve hours later, the inexplicable occurred. Weathers appeared, blinded, gloveless, and caked with ice&#x2014;walking down the mountain. In this powerful memoir, now featuring a new Preface, Weathers describes not only his escape from hypothermia and the murderous storm that killed eight climbers, but the journey of his life. This is the story of a man&#x2019;s route to a dangerous sport and a fateful expedition, as well as the road of recovery he has traveled since; of survival in the face of certain death, the reclaiming of a family and a life; and of the most extraordinary adventure of all: finding the courage to say yes when life offers us a second chance.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for <i>Left for Dead</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Riveting . . .

It goes past the tragedy to discuss why Weathers got involved in climbing in the first place, his lengthy and painful recovery, and the all-important relationship with his wife, Margaret (commonly referred to as Peach). Without Peach's hope and tenacity, it's likely that rescue efforts would not have been continued, and Weathers may never have recovered from the hypothermic coma and its dreadful results. The story of their relationship--they were estranged at the time of the accident--is told from both perspectives, and his obsession with mountains seems almost like another family member. The overall tone is straightforward and conversational: children, pets, and clothing feature as prominently as reconstructive surgery and heroic rescues. But no matter how plainly they are told, the events of that climb are sure to bring tears. Rob Hall's last conversation with his wife, climbers disappearing into the storm, Anatoli Boukreev's rescuing three people, and Weathers and climbing partner Yasuko being left for dead are just a few from a long list. Still, you'll find yourself laughing just pages later, when Weathers gets his rescue team to sing "Chain of Fools" while hiking back to safety--you can imagine Peach being in full agreement of that song's appropriateness. The Everest deaths affected people around the world, and this chronicle of one survivor and his family is a hopeful reminder of the good that can result from such tragedies. <i>--Jill Lightner</i>tell you that some force within me rejected death at the last moment and then guided me, blind and stumbling &#x2014; quite literally a dead man walking &#x2014; into camp and the shaky start of my return to life....&#x201d; <br><br>In 1996 Beck Weathers and a climbing team pushed toward the summit of Mount Everest.

One of the most critical of these tasks is new product development. The Lean Enterprise Institute is honored to publish Lean Product and Process Development, by Allen Ward, one of the pioneers in the study and practice of lean product development. In this breakthrough text, Ward asks basic questions that drive at the fundamentals of product development, and observes the sources (a.k.a. wastes) of the most common maladies that plague many product development organizations. He distills what might be termed cornerstones from the practices of lean product developers, which differ remarkably from conventional practice. Ward uniquely melds observations of effective teamwork from his military background, engineering fundamentals from his education and personal experience, design methodology from his research, and theories about management, cognition, and learning from his understanding of history and interactions with clients. With Lean Product and Process Development, Ward carries the implications of his theories into specific, practical recommendations, and employs systems thinking in all aspects of thought and investigation.</p><p></p><h2>Psychoanalytic Technique and Psychic Conflict</h2><p>Psychoanalytic Technique and Psychic Conflict [Hardcover]</p><p></p><h2>Modern Classics the Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>Desiderio, an employee of the city under a bizarre reality attack from Doctor Hoffman&#39;s mysterious machines, has fallen in love with Albertina, the Doctor&#39;s daughter.

Often hailed as a renaissance man of the 20th century, Welles is captured in a legendary series of conversations between himself and director Peter Bogdanovich. 82 photos.</p><p>In 1992, the first publication of <i>This Is Orson Welles</i> brought a priceless document to light. In the late '60s and early '70s, filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich had conducted extensive interviews with Welles, but a number of circumstances--including the director's decision to compose an autobiography that he never got around to writing--kept the interviews out of the public eye. Edited and annotated by Jonathan Rosenbaum, these conversations give wonderful insights into Welles's craft and personality. He discusses his forays into acting, producing, and writing as well as directing, his confidences and insecurities, and his plans for film projects that were either never made or only partially completed. He also offers insights into the triumph of <i>Citizen Kane</i> and later masterpieces like <i>The Lady from Shanghai</i>, <i>Touch of Evil</i>, <i>Othello</i>, and <i>Chimes at Midnight</i>. His defense of his controversial adaptation of Kafka's <i>The Trial</i> is so fascinating that readers might want to rush out and rent the film.<p> While the book is worth owning just for this 322-page interview, it is also full of other material that is equally revealing. Rosenbaum presents a meticulous chronology of Welles's life, closely following his day-to-day activities from his birth in 1915 to his death in 1985. Anyone who thinks that Welles was an essentially lazy and profligate artist will be astonished at how hard he worked and how much he accomplished, even after the completion of <i>Citizen Kane</i>. Another treat found in the book is a detailed description--complete with rare photographic stills--of the original <i>Magnificent Ambersons</i>, Welles's impressive follow-up to <i>Kane</i>, which can now be seen only in a tragically truncated version. </p><p> This 1998 reissue of the volume contains a fond new introduction by Bogdanovich and another crucial piece of Welles minutia, excerpts from his 58-page memo to Universal Pictures about the editing of <i>Touch of Evil</i>. Forty years after its composition, the material in this memo has been used to create a restored "director's cut" of the film. With such grand material between two covers, <i>This Is Orson Welles</i> is the most informative and entertaining book available on one of the 20th century's greatest artists. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i></p>Orson Welles (1915-1985) was the last true Renaissance man of the twentieth century. From such great radio works as &#34;War of the Worlds&#34; to his cinematic masterpieces Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, Othello, Macbeth, Touch of Evil, and Chimes at Midnight, Welles was a master storyteller.

There&#x2019;s only one person who has ever truly understood fourteen-year-old June Elbus, and that&#x2019;s her uncle, the renowned painter Finn Weiss. Shy at school and distant from her older sister, June can only be herself in Finn&#x2019;s company; he is her godfather, confidant, and best friend. So when he dies, far too young, of a mysterious illness her mother can barely speak about, June&#x2019;s world is turned upside down.

But beyond that, she tells a universal story of how love chooses us, and how flashes of our beloved live through us even after they&#x2019;re gone. Before her Uncle Finn died of an illness people don&#x2019;t want to talk about, 14-year-old June Elbus thought she was the center of his world. A famous and reclusive painter, Finn made her feel uniquely understood, privy to secret knowledge like how to really hear Mozart&#x2019;s <em>Requiem</em> or see the shape of negative space. When he&#x2019;s gone, she discovers he had a bigger secret: his longtime partner Toby, the only other person who misses him as much as she does. Her clandestine friendship with Toby&#x2014;who her parents blame for Finn&#x2019;s illness&#x2014;sharpens tensions with her sister, Greta, until their bond seems to exist only in the portrait Finn painted of them. With wry compassion, Brunt portrays the bitter lengths to which we will go to hide our soft underbellies, and how summoning the courage to be vulnerable is the only way to see through to each other&#x2019;s hungry, golden souls. --<em>Mari Malcolm</em><b>Carol Rifka Brunt</b>&#x2019;s work has appeared in several literary journals, includin<i>g North American Review</i> and <i>The Sun.</i> In 2006, she was one of three fiction writers who received the New Writing Ventures award and, in 2007, she received a generous Arts Council grant to write <i>Tell the Wolves I&#x2019;m Home,</i> her first novel. Originally from New York, she currently lives in England with her husband and three children.</p><h2>Pontius Pilate</h2><p>Pontius Pilate arrived in Judaea in the year 26, sent to collect taxes and oversee the firm establishment of Roman law. His ten-year term was a time of relative peace in this fractious new outpost of the Roman Empire, where violence was not uncommon. He was not loved and not quite feared, and might have vanished into obscurity had he not come to preside, with some reluctance, over the most famous trial in history.<br><br>In this brilliant biography, a finalist for the Samuel Johnson Prize and a masterpiece of scholarship and imagination, Ann Wroe brings Pilate and his world to life. Working from classical sources, she reconstructs his origins and upbringing, his career in the military and life in Rome, his confrontation with Christ, and his long journey home. We catch glimpses of him pacing the marble floors in Caesarea, sharpening his stylus, getting dressed shortly before sunrise on the day that would seal his place in history. What were the pressures on Pilate that day? What did he really think of Jesus? <i>Pontius Pilate</i> lets us see Christ's trial for the first time, in all its confusion, from the point of view of his executioner. <br><br>Pontius Pilate is a historical figure, like Cleopatra and Alexander, who has been endlessly mythologized through the ages. For some he is a saint, for others the embodiment of human weakness, an archetypal politician willing to sacrifice one man for the sake of stability. Each generation has pressed onto Pilate the imprint of its anxieties and its faith. He has haunted&#x2014;and continues to haunt&#x2014;our imagination. From the Evangelists and the Copts (for whom he was a saint, martyred himself on the Cross) to more recent philosophers, artists, novelists, and politicians, Pilate has been resurrected in different guises for two thousand years. Ann Wroe brings man and myth to life in a book that expands the possibilities of the biographical form and deepens our understanding of the mysteries of faith.<br><br>It has often been said that Pontius Pilate was fingered by God to carry out the divine plan of salvation, just as clearly as Christ was. Ann Wroe shows how, in his hesitation before God, in his skepticism, his anxiety to do his job and exonerate himself of guilt, Pilate's story is very much our own.</p><p><i>Pontius Pilate</i>, by Ann Wroe, is beautifully written, imaginatively researched, and intricately structured. Most importantly, it provides readers with a valuable emotional experience: a chance to rediscover and redeem Pilate's famous question--"What is truth?"--in a spirit of humility and hope. A handful of small coins and one inscribed stone are the only physical evidence that Pilate existed. All of the textual sources that mention Pilate, Wroe notes, are "so wrapped in propaganda or agendas that it is difficult to detect what, if anything, may be true." But since Pilate "stands at the center of the Christian story and God's plan of redemption," Wroe persevered in her efforts to discern the profile of his life. "Without his climactic judgment of Jesus, the world would not have been saved. To have a faceless bureaucrat at the heart of all this drama was unacceptable: something had to be made of this man." The book's bold ambition, however, is not blind. "This is not a search for the 'real' Pilate," Wroe admits. "At best, all we have are glints and hypotheses." To learn about her subject, Wroe had to sacrifice most of her sympathetic impulses and shift her concentration to the elements of Roman life that she did not understand. And oddly enough, the passages in which Wroe describes her ignorance most clearly are where we begin to glimpse "a man actually walking on a marble floor in Caesarea, feeling his shoes pinch, clicking his fingers for a slave, while clouds of lasting infamy gather overhead.""Sublime...For a long time this book will remain the definitive study of Pilate."<br></p><h2>Saint Joseph: Shadow of the Father</h2><p>Allusions, prefigurations and prophecies concerning the role of St. Joseph in the plan of God the Father, form the backdrop to this book which charts the growth of devotion to Joseph from the first centuries of the Church up to the present. Using biblical reflections, pastoral experience and the personal prayers and thoughts of such great devotees of Joseph as Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, Bernadette of Lourdes and Therese of Lisieux, the author portrays a vivid picture of the man chosen to be the foster father of Jesus.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Face Of War</h2><p>A collection of the author&#39;s war journalism, covering her reports on the conflicts in Spain, Finland, China and World War II, with later reports on Vietnam, Israel and Central America.</p><p>Martha Gellhorn (1908-1998) was a war correspondent for nearly fifty years. From the Spanish Civil War in 1937 through the wars in Central America in the mid-eighties, her candid reports reflected her feelings for people no matter what their political ideologies, and the openness and vulnerability of her conscience. "I wrote very fast, as I had to," she says, "afraid that I would forget the exact sound, smell, words, gestures, which were special to this moment and this place." Whether in Java, Finland, the Middle East, or Vietnam, she used the same vigorous approach. Collected here together for the first time, The Face of War is what The New York Times called "a brilliant anti-war book." <p>"A brilliant anti-war book that is as fresh as if written for this morning. Seldom can a correspondent assemble past writings from various locations and watch a clear pattern emerge, yet her pieces fall into place in a grand design."-Herbert Mitgang, The New York Times </p><p>Martha Gellhorn was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1908. She was married to Ernest Hemingway from 1940 to 1946 and T. S. Matthews from 1954 to 1963. She was a war correspondent for Collier's Weekly of New York from 1937 to 1946 and for The Guardian of London from 1966 to 1967. In addition to her journalism, she wrote seven novels and four short-story collections. In 1958 she was the recipient of an O. Henry Award.

Through incisive, morally engaging conversations with some of the leading political figures, writers, activists, poets, and scholars at work today, the Journal captured the essence of the past three pivotal years in American life and politics, including the final act of the Bush Administration and the early years of Obama.<br> <br>Now, <i>Bill Moyers Journal: The Conversation Continues</i> brings this groundbreaking work to the page. From Michael Pollan, David Simon, and Jane Goodall to John Grisham, Karen Armstrong, and Barbara Ehrenreich, <i>Bill Moyers Journal: The Conversation Continues</i> introduces the ideas that matter today&#x2014;on subjects as diverse as the politics of food, race in the age of Obama, aging in America, the power of poetry, wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan, the conflict over gay marriage, and the fate of the American newspaper.<br> <br>With extensive new commentary from Bill Moyers&#x2014;in the tradition of his national bestsellers <i>A World of Ideas</i> and <i>Healing and the Mind</i>&#x2014;here is an unparalleled guide to the debates, the cultural currents, and above all the fascinating people who have so powerfully shaped the world we live in.</p><p><b>Bill Moyers</b> was a founding organizer of the Peace Corps, a senior White House assistant (and press secretary) to President Lyndon Johnson from 1963 until 1967, the publisher of <i>Newsday,</i> a senior news analyst for CBS News, and the producer of groundbreaking series for public television. He is the winner of more than thirty Emmy awards and nine Peabody awards. Among his bestselling books are <i>Listening to America,</i> <i>A World of Ideas,</i> <i>The Power of Myth</i> (with Joseph Campbell), and <i>Moyers on America.</i> He lives in New York City.<br>Readers of his new book will feast on four dozen wide-ranging conversations which brim with big ideas and deep insights. Provocative, absorbing and necessary.&#x201d;<br> Minneapolis <i>Star Tribune</i> <br> <br>"Culled from Moyers&#x2019;s third PBS series, which ran from 2007 to 2010, there&#x2019;s no small talk or superficiality in these interviews with 47 'independent thinkers.' The topics are far-reaching (faith, populism, the Israeli occupation of Gaza, aging, lynching in America, health care, capitalism, capital punishment, lobbyists in Washington), and the guest list is wide-ranging (pediatrician Margaret Flowers, biologist E. O. Wilson, historian Howard Zinn, economist Victor Greidel, writer David Simon, minister Jeremiah Wright, lawyer Philippe Sands, journalist Victor Gold, novelist John Grisham, theologian James Cone). Karen Armstrong urges us to find the commonalities in diverse religious traditions, notably compassion. Jeremy Scahill alerts us that Blackwater&#x2019;s Eric Prince 'is a man who is building up nothing short of a parallel national security apparatus.' John Lithgow shares some of his favorite poems; Jane Goodall turns one&#x2019;s attention to the animal world. In an era of much instant and ephemeral talk, it is a pleasurable thing to hold this 'book of ideas.' These challenging, engaged conversations reward the reader&#x2019;s serious attention. There are no sound bites here, just food for thought."<br> <i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br> <br>Starred Review. "The PBS series <i>Bill Moyers Journal</i> aired weekly from 2007 to 2010, capturing discussions of pivotal issues at the close of the Bush administration and the start of the Obama era. This companion book recaptures those compelling discussions on issues that matter, covering politics, economics, race, foreign policy, and the environment. Among the 47 interviews are Michael Pollan on our unsustainable food producing and eating habits; Robert Wright on the evolution of religion and why there&#x2019;s hope for an end to religious wars; David Simon, creator of <i>The Wire,</i> on the war on drugs as a war on the underclass; John Lithgow on acting in the play <i>All My Sons</i> and the gut-wrenching immediacy of war profiteering; journalist William Greider on Wall Street corruption; and Michelle Alexander and Bryan Stevenson on mass incarceration of minorities in the U.S. The collection also includes Sam Tanenhaus and Victor Gold expounding on the death of traditional conservatism, and Nikki Giovanni, Martin Espada, and Maxine Hong Kingston reading poetry and discussing the impact of literature on society. Each interview is preceded by background on the interview subject and the context of the conversation. In the style for which he&#x2019;s known, Moyers probes with respect, intelligence, curiosity, humor, and graciousness."<br> <i>Booklist</i> <br></p><h2>Chance, Love, and Logic: Philosophical Essays</h2><p><i>Chance, Love, and Logic</i> contains two books by Charles Sanders Peirce (1839&#x2013;1914) which are among his most important and widely influential. The first is <i>Illustrations&nbsp;of the Logic of Science</i>. The opening chapters, &#x201c;The Fixation of Belief&#x201d; and &#x201c;How to Make Our Ideas Clear,&#x201d; mark the beginning of pragmatism. The second presents Peirce&#x2019;s innovative and influential essays on scientific metaphysics.</p><p>Morris Raphael Cohen is the author of Law and the Social Order and Reason and Nature. Kenneth Laine Ketner is Charles Sanders Peirce Professor of Philosophy at Texas Tech University and the author of His Glassy Essence."One of the most original thinkers and system builders of any time, and certainly the greatest philosopher the United States has ever seen."&#x2014;Joseph Brent, author of <i>Charles Sanders Peirce: A Life</i> (Joseph Brent)<br><br>"Peirce&#x2019;s achievements would take a short book to describe adequately. In philosophy, he founded the most distinctively American school of thought&#x2014;Pragmatism. As the founder of pragmatism, he was the intellectual hero of both John Dewey and William James. He also created single-handedly the large discipline called Semeiotic&#x2014;the study of the working of signs&#x2014;a discipline which engages scholars all over the world. He was perhaps the first modern Historian of Science, and he was certainly one of the great founders of Mathematical Logic. He was, in truth, one of the rare thinkers who deserves the overworked title of 'genius.'"&#x2014;Hilary Putnam, author of <i>Pragmatism: An Open Question</i> (Hilary Putnam)<br><br>"Most people never heard of him, but they will."&#x2014;Walker Percy (Walker Percy)</p><h2>The Mercedes Coffin: A Decker and Lazarus Book</h2><p><p>Billionaire genius Genoa Greeves never got over the shocking death of her favorite teacher, Bennett "Dr. Ben" Alston Little, murdered execution-style and stuffed into the trunk of his Mercedes-Benz. No arrests were ever made, no killer charged for the brutal crime. Fifteen years later, the high-tech CEO reads about another execution-style murder; this time the victim is a Hollywood music producer named Primo Ekerling. There is no obvious connection, but the case is eerily similar to Little's and Genoa feels the time is right to close Dr. Ben's case once and for all&#x2014;offering the L.A.P.D. a substantial financial "incentive" if justice is finally served for Little.</p><p>Lieutenant Peter Decker resents having to commit valuable manpower to a fifteen-year-old open case simply because a rich woman says "Jump!" Still, the recent murder of Primo Ekerling does bear a disturbing resemblance to Little's case, even though two thug suspects are currently behind bars for the Ekerling murder. Decker can't help but wonder about a connection. His first phone calls are to the two primary investigators in the Little case, retired detectives Calvin Vitton and Arnie Lamar. Lamar is cooperative, but Vitton is not only reluctant to talk, he winds up dead of a suspicious suicide twelve hours later. Plunging into this long-buried murder, Decker discovers that even though the two slayings are separated by a decade and a half, there is still plenty of greed, lust, and evil to connect the dots.</p><p>Decker's team of top investigators not only includes his favorite homicide detectives, Scott Oliver and Marge Dunn, but also his newly minted Hollywood detective daughter, Cindy Kutiel, whose help proves to be invaluable. His wife, Rina Lazarus, continues to be his backbone of support, offering a cool, rational outlook despite her growing concern for her husband's welfare and safety. Rina's worries and fears begin to build at a fevered pitch as past and present collide with a vengeance, catapulting an unsuspecting Peter Decker closer and closer to the edge of an infinite dark abyss.</p><p>A relentlessly gripping tale spun by a master, Faye Kellerman's <em>The Mercedes Coffin</em> races through a dangerous urban world of fleeting fame and false dreams, making heart-pumping hairpin turns at each step of a terrifying journey, where truth and justice are fine lines between life and death. </p></p><p><p>Faye Kellerman lives with her husband, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Jonathan Kellerman, in Los Angeles, California, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. </p>Part of the fun of reading&nbsp;Kellerman&#x2019;s early Decker-Lazarus&nbsp;mysteries is the infusion of Jewish tradition in the mix. In recent years, however,&nbsp;series entries have&nbsp;given&nbsp;Rina Lazarus, Decker&#x2019;s lively, clever wife,&nbsp;a decidedly minor role. Although that&#x2019;s certainly the case here, Kellerman compensates somewhat&nbsp;by writing with&nbsp;her usual zest, and&nbsp;telling the story almost exclusively in&nbsp;dialogue, which not only&nbsp;quickens the pace&nbsp;but also allows readers an intimate glimpse of how the detectives&nbsp;patch together the&nbsp;clues. The body of a music producer stuffed into the trunk of a Mercedes left parked in a remote spot attracts the attention of a millionaire businesswoman, whose favorite teacher, Ben Little,&nbsp;was similarly killed 15 years before.&nbsp;Wondering if the murders are linked,&nbsp;she promises a big payoff to the&nbsp;LAPD if Little&#x2019;s murder is solved. The pressure&#x2019;s on Lieutenant Peter Decker, and, of course, everyone he&nbsp;talks to has something to hide&#x2014;Little&#x2019;s wife, the gangbanger turned basketball coach, a musician gone crazy, even the cop who investigated Little&#x2019;s murder.&nbsp;Although&nbsp;Decker never ties up all the loose ends, he eventually answers enough of the questions to&nbsp;put bad guys behind bars, win over&nbsp;Miss Moneybags, please his&nbsp;boss&#x2014;and&nbsp;satisfy his many fans. --Stephanie Zvirin</p><h2>The Slow Regard of Silent Things: A Kingkiller Chronicle Novella</h2><p><b>Discover #1 <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling Patrick Rothfuss&#x2019; epic fantasy universe of The Kingkiller Chronicle, in this illustrated companion novella, <i>The Slow Regard of Silent Things</i>. </b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;I just love the world of Patrick Rothfuss.&#x201d; &#x2014;Lin-Manuel Miranda � &#x201c;He&#x2019;s bloody good, this Rothfuss guy.&#x201d; &#x2014;George R.

She was quite sure of it. He would come for a visit on the seventh day.</p><p>A long time. Long for waiting. But not so long for everything that needed to be done. Not if she were careful. Not if she wanted to be ready.</p><p>Opening her eyes, Auri saw a whisper of dim light. A rare thing, as she was tucked tidily away in Mantle, her privatest of places. It was a white day, then. A deep day. A finding day. She smiled, excitement fizzing in her chest.</p><p>There was just enough light to see the pale shape of her arm as her fingers found the dropper bottle on her bedshelf. She unscrewed it and let a single drip fall into Foxen&#x2019;s dish. After a moment he slowly brightened into a faint gloaming blue.</p><p>Moving carefully, Auri pushed back her blanket so it wouldn&#x2019;t touch the floor. She slipped out of bed, the stone floor warm beneath her feet. Her basin rested on the table near her bed, next to a sliver of her sweetest soap. None of it had changed in the night. That was good.</p><p>Auri squeezed another drop directly onto Foxen. She hesitated, then grinned and let a third drop fall. No half measures on a finding day. She gathered up her blanket then, folding and folding it up, carefully tucking it under her chin to keep it from brushing against the floor.</p><p>Foxen&#x2019;s light continued to swell. First the merest flickering: a fleck, a distant star. Then more of him began to iridesce, a firefly&#x2019;s worth. Still more his brightness grew till he was all-over tremulant with shine. Then he sat proudly in his dish, looking like a blue-green ember slightly larger than a coin.</p><p>She smiled at him while he roused himself the rest of the way and he filled all of Mantle with his truest, brightest blue-white light.</p><p>Then Auri looked around. She saw her perfect bed. Just her size. Just so. She checked her sitting chair. Her cedar box. Her tiny silver cup.</p><p>The fireplace was empty. And above that was the mantelpiece: her yellow leaf, her box of stone, her grey glass jar with sweet dried lavender inside. Nothing was nothing else. Nothing was anything it shouldn&#x2019;t be.</p><p>There were three ways out of Mantle. There was a hallway, and a doorway, and a door. The last of these was not for her.</p><p>Auri took the doorway into Port. Foxen was still resting in his dish, so his light was dimmer here, but it was still bright enough to see. Port had not been very busy of late, but even so, Auri checked on everything in turn. In the wine rack rested half a broken plate of porcelain, no thicker than the petal of a flower. Below that was a leather octavo book, a pair of corks, a tiny ball of twine. Off to one side, his fine white teacup waited for him with a patience Auri envied.</p><p>On the wall shelf sat a blob of yellow resin in a dish. A black rock. A grey stone. A smooth, flat piece of wood. Apart from all the rest, a tiny bottle stood, its wire bale open like a hungry bird.</p><p>On the central table a handful of holly berries rested on a clean white cloth. Auri eyed them for a moment, then took them to the bookshelf, a perch they were more suited to. She looked around the room and nodded to herself. All good.</p><p>Back in Mantle, Auri washed her face and hands and feet. She slipped out of her nightshirt and folded it into her cedar box. She stretched happily, lifting up her arms and rolling high onto her toes.</p><p>Then she ducked into her favorite dress, the one he&#x2019;d given her. It was sweet against her skin. Her name was burning like a fire inside her. Today was going to be a busy day.</p><p>Auri gathered up Foxen, carrying him cupped in the palm of her hand. She made her way through Port, slipping through a jagged crack in the wall. It was not a wide crack, but Auri was so slight she barely needed turn her shoulders to keep from brushing up against the broken stones. It was nothing like a tight fit.</p><p>Van was a tall room with straight, white walls of fitted stone. It was an echo-empty place save for her standing mirror. But today there was one other thing, the gentlest breath of sunlight. It snuck in through the peak of an arched doorway filled with rubble: broken timber, blocks of fallen stone. But there, at the very top, a smudge of light.</p><p>Auri stood in front of the mirror and took the bristle brush from where it hung on the mirror&#x2019;s wooden frame. She brushed the sleep snarl from her hair until it hung about her like a cloud.</p><p>She closed her hand over Foxen, and without his blue-green shine the room went dark as dark. Then her eyes stretched wide and she could see nothing but the soft, faint smudge of warm light spilling past the rubble high behind her. Pale golden light caught in her pale golden hair. Auri grinned at herself in the mirror. She looked like the sun.</p><p>Lifting her hand, she uncovered Foxen and skipped quickly off into the sprawling maze of Rubric. It was barely a minute&#x2019;s work to find a copper pipe with the right kind of cloth wrapping. But finding the perfect <i>place</i>, well, that was the trick, wasn&#x2019;t it? She followed the pipe through the round red-brick tunnels for nearly half a mile, careful not to let it slip away from her among the countless other twining pipes.</p><p>Then, with no hint of warning, the pipe kinked hard and dove straight into the curving wall, abandoning her. Rude thing. There were countless other pipes of course, but the tiny tin ones had no wrap at all. The icy ones of burnished steel were far too new. The iron pipes were so eager as to be almost embarrassing, but their wrappings were all cotton, and that was more trouble than she cared to bother with today.</p><p>So Auri followed a fat ceramic pipe as it bumbled along. Eventually it burrowed deep into the ground, but where it bent, its linen wrap hung loose and ragged as an urchin&#x2019;s shirt. Auri smiled and unwound the strip of cloth with gentle fingers, taking great care not to tear it.</p><p>Eventually it came away. A perfect thing. A single gauzy piece of greying linen, long as Auri&#x2019;s arm. It was tired but willing, and after folding it upon itself she turned and pelted madly off through echoing Umbrel, then down and down into The Twelve.</p><p>The Twelve was one of the rare changing places of the Underthing. It was wise enough to know itself, and brave enough to <i>be</i> itself, and wild enough to change itself while somehow staying altogether true. It was nearly unique in this regard, and while it was not always safe or kind, Auri could not help but feel a fondness for it.</p><p>Today the high arch of space was just as she&#x2019;d expected, bright and lively. Sunlight speared down through the open gratings far above, striking down into the deep, narrow valley of the changing place. The light filtered past pipes, support beams, and the strong, straight line of an ancient wooden walkway. The distant noise of the street drifted down to the far below bottom of things.</p><p>Auri heard the sound of hooves on cobblestones, sharp and round as a cracking knuckle. She heard the distant thunder of a passing wagon and the dim mingle of voices. Threading through it all was the high, angry cry of a babe who clearly wanted tit and wasn&#x2019;t getting any.</p><p>At the bottom of The Yellow Twelve there was a long deep pool with water smooth as glass. The sunlight from above was bright enough that Auri could see all the way down to the second snarl of pipes beneath the surface.</p><p>She already had straw here, and three bottles waited on a narrow ledge of stone along one wall. But looking at them, Auri frowned. There was a green one, a brown one, and a clear one. There was a wide wire baling top, a grey twisting lid, and a cork fat as a fist. They were all different shapes and sizes, but none of them were quite right.</p><p>Exasperated, Auri threw her hands into the air.</p><p>So she ran back to Mantle, her bare feet slapping on the stone. Once there, she eyed the grey glass bottle with the lavender inside. She picked it up, looked it over carefully, then set it back down in its proper place before she scampered out again.</p><p>Auri hurried through Port, heading out by way of the slanting doorway this time, rather than the crack in the wall. She twisted up through Withy, Foxen throwing wild shadows on the walls. As she ran, her hair streamed out behind her like a banner.</p><p>She took the spiraling stairs through Darkhouse, down and around, down and around. When she finally heard moving water and the tink of glass she knew she&#x2019;d crossed the threshold into Clinks. Soon Foxen&#x2019;s light reflected off the roiling pool of black water that swallowed the bottom of the spiraling stairs.</p><p>There were two bottles perched in a shallow niche there. One blue and narrow. One green and squat. Auri tilted her head and closed one eye, then reached out to touch the green one with two fingers. She grinned, snatched it up, and ran back up the stairs.</p><p>Heading back, she went through Vaults for a change of air. Running down the hall, she sprang over the first deep fissure in the broken floor as lithely as a dancer. The second crack she leapt as lightly as a bird. The third she jumped as wildly as a pretty girl who looked like the sun.</p><p>She came into The Yellow Twelve all puffed and panting. As she caught her breath, she tucked Foxen in the green bottle, padded him carefully with straw, and locked down the hasp against the rubber gasket, sealing the lid down tight. She held it up to her face, then grinned and kissed the bottle before setting it carefully by the edge of the pool.</p><p>Auri shucked off her favorite dress and hung it on a bright brass pipe. She grinned and shivered a little, nervous fish swimming in her stomach. Then, standing in her altogether, she gathered up her floating hair with both her hands. She brushed it back and bound it, winding and tying it behind her with the strip of old grey linen cloth. When she was done it made a long tail that hung down to the small of her back.</p><p>Arms held close against her chest, Auri took two tiny steps to stand beside the pool. She dipped a toe into the water, then her whole foot. She grinned at the feel of it, chill and sweet as peppermint. Then she lowered herself down, both legs dangling in the water. Auri balanced for a moment, holding her nekkid self up with both hands, away from the cold stone lip at the edge of the pool.</p><p>But there was no avoiding it. So Auri puckered up and settled herself the rest of the way down. There was nothing peppermint about the cold stone edge. It was a dull, blunt bite against her tender altogether hindmost self.</p><p>She turned herself around then, and began to lower herself into the water. She went slowly, tickling around with her feet until she found the little jut of stone. She curled her toes around it, holding herself thigh-deep in the pool. Then she drew a few deep breaths, screwed her eyes shut, and bared her teeth before letting go with her toes and ducking her nethers underneath the surface. She squeaked a little, and the chill made her whole self go gooseprickle.</p><p>The worst over, she closed her eyes and dunked her head beneath the water too. Gasping and blinking, she rubbed the water out of her eyes. She had her big all-over shiver then, one arm folded across her breasts. But by the time it was done her grimace had turned to grin.</p><p>Without her halo of hair, Auri felt small. Not the smallness that she strove for every day. Not the smallness of a tree among trees. Of a shadow underground. And not just small of body either. She knew there was not much of her. When she thought to look more closely at her standing mirror, the girl she saw was tiny as an urchin begging on the street. The girl she saw was thin as thin. Her cheekbones high and delicate. Her collarbones pressed tight against her skin.</p><p>But no. With her hair pulled back and wetted down besides. She felt&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. less. She felt tamped down. Dim. More faint. Feint. Feigned. Fain. It would have been pure unpleasant without the perfect strip of linen. If not for that, she wouldn&#x2019;t merely feel like a wick rolled down, she would be downright guttery. It was worth it, doing things the proper way.</p><p>Finally the last of her trembling stopped. The fish were still turning in her stomach, but her grin was eager. The golden daylight from above struck down into the pool, straight and bright and steady as a spear.</p><p>Auri drew a deep breath, then pushed it out, wriggling her toes. She took another deep breath and let it out more slowly.</p><p>Then a third breath. Auri gripped the neck of Foxen&#x2019;s bottle in one hand, let go of the stone edge of the pool, and dove beneath the water.</p><p>The angle of the light was perfect, and Auri saw the first pipetangle clear as anything. Minnow-quick, she turned and glided smoothly through, not letting any of them touch her.</p><p>Below that was the second snarl. She pushed an old iron pipe with her foot to keep herself moving downward, then tugged a valve with her free hand as she went past, changing speed and sliding through the narrow space between two wrist-thick copper pipes.</p><p></p></p><h2>The Cul-de-sac Kids Books 1-6 (Boxed Set)</h2><p>This is an exciting and lighthearted chapter book series for young readers that centers on the often humorous escapades of a group of endearing neighborhood friends.</p><p><b>Beverly Lewis</b>, born in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, has more than 17 million books in print.

For Joanna Eberhart, a recent arrival with her husband and two children, it all seems too perfect to be true -- from the sweet, accommodating Welcome Wagon lady to all those cheerful, friendly faces in the supermarket checkout lines. But just beneath the town's flawless surface, something is sordid and wrong -- something abominable with roots in the local Men's Association. And it may already be too late for Joanna to save herself from being devoured by Stepford's hideous perfection.</p></p><p><p>Novelist and playwright Ira Levin (1929-2007) was a native New Yorker whose books include <em>A Kiss Before Dying</em>, <em>Rosemary's Baby</em>, <em>This Perfect Day</em>, <em>The Stepford Wives</em>, <em>The Boys from Brazil</em>, <em>Sliver</em>, and <em>Son of Rosemary</em>. His plays include <em>No Time for Sergeants</em>, <em>Critic's Choice</em>, and the longest-running thriller in Broadway history, <em>Deathtrap</em>. An alumnus of New York University, Levin also wrote the lyrics of the Barbra Streisand classic "He Touched Me," and was the recipient of three Edgar Allan Poe Awards from the Mystery Writers of America (including 2003's 'Grand Master'), as well as the Horror Writers Association's Bram Stoker Award for lifetime achievement.</p>Levin was a hot commodity in the 1960s and 1970s, cranking out horror potboilers like Rosemary's Baby, The Boys from Brazil, and this 1972 title, all of which share the common theme that people aren't always who or what they seem. This slim volume finds protagonist Joanna and husband Walter and kids leaving the wicked city for the bucolic town of Stepford. Despite its ideal facade, the sleepy little storybook town actually is more wicked. Joanna soon notices that her female neighbors are all body and no brains and seemingly exist only to do housework while their husbands gather nightly at a mysterious men's club. Even worse, it appears that the women who moved there just before her suddenly begin morphing into hausfraus built like swimsuit models-and she's next! It's hard to tell if this is a stab at the feminist movement or simply a male fantasy, but it's a fun read and will keep you turning the pages.

Twelve distinguished historians from many countries examine the image of women in the masculine mind, their social condition, and their daily experience from the demise of the Roman Empire to the genesis of the Italian Renaissance.</p><p>More than in any other era, a medieval woman&#x2019;s place in society was determined by men; her sexuality was perceived as disruptive and dangerous, her proper realm that of the home and cloister. The authors draw upon the writings of bishops and abbots, moralists and merchants, philosophers and legislators, to illuminate how men controlled women&#x2019;s lives. Sumptuary laws regulating feminine dress and ornament, pastoral letters admonishing women to keep silent and remain chaste, and learned treatises with their fantastic theories about women&#x2019;s physiology are fully explored in these pages. As adoration of the Virgin Mary reached full flower by the year 1200, ecclesiastics began to envision motherhood as a holy role; misogyny, however, flourished unrestrained in local proverbs, secular verses, and clerical thought throughout the period.</p><p>Were women&#x2019;s fates sealed by the dictates of church and society? The authors investigate legal, economic, and demographic aspects of family and communal life between the sixth and the fifteenth centuries and bring to light the fleeting moments in which women managed to seize some small measure of autonomy over their lives. The notion that courtly love empowered feudal women is discredited in this volume. The pattern of wear on a hearthstone, fingerprints on a terracotta pot, and artifacts from everyday life such as scissors, thimbles, spindles, and combs are used to reconstruct in superb detail the commonplace tasks that shaped women&#x2019;s existence inside and outside the home. As in antiquity, male fantasies and fears are evident in art. Yet a growing number of women rendered visions of their own gender in sumptuous tapestries and illuminations. The authors look at the surviving texts of female poets and mystics and document the stirrings of a quiet revolution throughout the West, as a few daring women began to preserve their thoughts in writing.</p></p><p><p>Christiane Klapisch-Zuber is Director of Studies (Retired) and Associated Member at the �cole des Hautes �tudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris.</p><p>Georges Duby, a member of the Acad�mie Fran�aise, is Professor of Medieval History at the Coll�ge de France.</p><p>Michelle Perrot is Professor of Contemporary History at the Universit� de Paris VII.</p>This five-volume work addresses the history of women from the ancients to the 1980s. Editors George Duby et al. state that this series of books "is the product of a revolutionAan ongoing, far-reaching revolution in the relations between men and women in Western societies." It therefore focuses on the western European experience with some attention to North America and "is intended to be not so much a history of women as a history of the relation between the sexes" because that is "the crux of the problem, the source of women's identity and otherness." <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>NG Backyard Guide to the Night Sky</h2><p>Stargazing&#39;s too much fun to leave to astronomers, but often we&#39;re blinded by science-dry facts can easily turn enchantment into a chore.

Throughout the evening, the chaos grows into a complex web of conflicting memories, hurt feelings, rivalries, alliances, and shared awareness. 208 pp. Author tour. National publicity. Print ads. 20,000 print.</p><p>There are, as the title says, one hundred brothers in Donald Antrim's novel. This sprawling fraternity has gathered in the family library for a dinner and over the course of a few hours, the author serves up sibling rivalry, revelry, and mayhem in meticulous, unflappable style. <p> For the most part, <i>The Hundred Brothers</i> skates along on the strength of its comic ingenuity. Yet Antrim has some serious points to make about masculine pride, vanity, and terror--not by invoking them directly, but by inflating them to monstrous (and mirthful) proportions. And the narrator's comments about his rampaging kin often have a larger, melancholic resonance to them. Indeed, when he points out "the complexities of our interdependence and the sorry indignities that pass as currency between us in lieu of gentler tender," he might be talking about any family--even one in the single-digit range.</p>"Line for line, Donald Antrim may be the best young male writer in America; his books . . . pack a vicious satiric punch." --Details<br><br>"The author's surreal vision is both imaginative and wholly his own. . . .

There were three of them this time, two boys and a girl. The oldest was about my age, seventeen and skinny, with huge frightened eyes and greasy dark hair that hung to his shoulders. The other two were even younger, fourteen and fifteen if I had to guess, and siblings, since they both had the same stringy yellow hair. I didn't know them; they weren't part of my crowd. Still, they had the same look of all Unregistereds; thin and ragged, their eyes darting about like trapped animals. I crossed my arms tightly, feeling their desperation. It was over. The trap had closed; the hunters had caught them, and there was no place for them to run.<br><br>The pet stood on the edge of the platform, puffed up and swaggering, as if he had caught the kids himself. He was walking back and forth, pointing to the condemned and rattling off a list of crimes, his pale eyes gleaming with triumph.<br><br>"...assaulting a citizen of the Inner City, robbery, trespassing and resisting arrest. These criminals attempted to steal Class One foodstuffs from the private warehouse of the Inner City. This is a crime against you, and more important, a crime against our benevolent Masters."<br><br>I snorted. Fancy words and legal mumbo jumbo didn't erase the fact that these "criminals" were just doing what all Unregistereds did to survive. For whatever reasons, fate, pride or stubbornness, we nonregistered humans didn't have the mark of our vampire masters etched into our skin, the brands that told you who you were, where you lived and who you belonged to. Of course, the vampires said it was to keep us safe, to keep track of everyone within the city, to know how much food they had to allow for. It was for our own good. Yeah, right. Call it what you wanted, it was just another way to keep their human cattle enslaved. You might as well be wearing a collar around your neck.<br><br>There were several good things about being Unregistered. You didn't exist. You were off their records, a ghost in the system. Because your name wasn't on the lists, you didn't have to show up for the monthly bloodletting, where human pets in crisp white coats stuck a tube in your vein and siphoned your blood into clear bags that were placed into coolers and taken to the Masters. Miss a couple lettings and the guards came for you, forcing you to pony up the late blood, even if it left you empty as a limp sack. The vamps got their blood, one way or another.<br><br>Being Unregistered let you slip through the cracks. There was no leash for the bloodsuckers to yank on. And since it wasn't exactly a crime, you'd think everyone would do it. Unfortunately, being free came with a hefty price. Registered humans got meal tickets. Unregistereds didn't. And since the vamps controlled all the food in the city, this made getting enough to eat a real problem.<br><br>So we did what anyone in our situation would do. We begged. We stole. We scraped up food wherever we could, did anything to survive. In the Fringe, the outermost circle of the vampire city, food was scarce even if you weren't Unregistered. The ration trucks came twice a month and were heavily guarded. I'd seen Registered citizens beaten just for getting out of line. So while it wasn't exactly a crime to be Unregistered, if you got <em>caught</em> stealing from the bloodsuckers and you didn't have the Prince's cursed brand gracing your skin, you could expect no mercy whatsoever.<br><br>It was a lesson I'd learned well. Too bad these three never did.<br><br>"...eight ounces of soy, two potatoes, and a quarter loaf of bread." The pet was still going on, and his audience had their eyes glued to the gallows now, morbidly fascinated. I slipped into the crowd, moving away from the platform. The smug voice rang out behind me, and I clenched my hands, wishing I could drive a fist through his smiling teeth. Damn pets. In some ways, they were even worse than the bloodsuckers. They'd chosen to serve the vamps, selling out their fellow humans for the safety and luxury it brought. Everyone hated them, but at the same time everyone was jealous of them, as well.<br><br>"The rules regarding Unregistered citizens are clear." The pet was wrapping up, stretching out his words for the greatest effect. "According to clause twenty-two, line forty-six of New Covington law, any human found stealing within city limits, who does not have the mark of protection from the Prince, shall be hanged by the neck until they are dead. Do the accused have any last words?"<br><br>I heard muffled voices, the oldest thief swearing at the pet, telling him to do something anatomically impossible. I shook my head. Brave words wouldn't help him. Nothing would now. It was fine and good to be defiant to the end, but it was better not to get caught in the first place. That was his first mistake and, ultimately, his last. <em>Always leave yourself an out;</em> that was the first rule of the Unregistereds. Do whatever you want&#x2014;hate the vamps, curse the pets&#x2014;but never get caught. I picked up my pace, hurrying past the edge of the crowd, and broke into a jog.<br><br>The clunk of the trapdoors releasing echoed very loudly in my ears, even over the gasp of the watching crowd. The silence that followed was almost a living thing, urging me to turn, to glance over my shoulder. Ignoring the knot in my stomach, I slipped around a corner, putting the wall between myself and the gallows so I wouldn't be tempted to look back.<br><br>Life in the Fringe is a simple thing, like the people who live here. They don't have to work, though there are a couple "trading posts" set up around the Fringe, where people collect what they find and exchange it for other things. They don't have to read; there are no jobs that require it, and besides, owning books is highly illegal&#x2014;so why risk it? All they have to worry about is feeding themselves, keeping their clothes mended, and patching up whatever hole or box or gutted out building they call home well enough to keep the rain off them.<br><br>The secret goal of almost every Fringer is to someday make it into the Inner City, past the wall that separates the civilized world from the human trash, into the glittering city that looms over us with its great starry towers that had somehow resisted crumbling into dust. Everyone knows someone who knows someone who was taken into the city, a brilliant mind or a great beauty, someone too unique or special to be left here with us animals. There are rumors that the vampires "breed" the humans on the inside, raising the children to be their thralls, completely devoted to their masters. But since none who are Taken into the city ever come out again&#x2014;ex-cept the pets and their guards, and they aren't talking&#x2014;no one knows what it's really like.<br><br>Of course, this only feeds the stories.<br><br>"Did you hear?" Stick asked as I met him at the chain-link fence that marked the edge of our territory. Beyond the fence, across a grassy, glass-strewn lot, stood a squat old building that my gang and I called home. Lucas, the de facto leader of our gang, said it used to be a "school," a place where kids like us gathered every day in huge numbers to learn. That was before the vamps had it gutted and burned, destroying everything on the inside, but it was still a refuge for a gang of skinny street rats. Three stories high, the brick walls were beginning to crumble, the top floor had fallen in, and the halls were filled with mold, rubble and little else. The charred halls and empty rooms were cold, damp and dark, and every year a little more of the walls fell away, but it was our place, our safe haven, and we were fiercely protective of it.<br><br>"Hear what?" I asked as we ducked through the gap in the rusty fence, striding through weeds and grass and broken bottles to where home beckoned invitingly.<br><br>"Gracie was Taken last night. Into the city. They say some vampire was looking to expand his harem, so he took her."<br><br>I looked at him sharply. "What? Who told you that?"<br><br>"Kyle and Travis."<br><br>I rolled my eyes in disgust. Kyle and Travis belonged to a rival gang of Unregistereds. We didn't bother each other, usually, but this sounded like something our competitors would concoct just to scare us off the streets. "You believe anything those two say? They're screwing with you, Stick. They want to scare you."<br><br>He trailed me across the lot like a shadow, watery blue gaze darting about. Stick's real name was Stephen, but no one called him that anymore. He was taller than me by several inches, but my five-foot nothing didn't make this feat all that impressive. Stick was built like a scarecrow, with straw-colored hair and timid eyes. He managed to survive on the streets, but just barely. "They're not the only ones talking about it," he insisted. "Cooper said he heard her scream a few blocks away. What does that tell you?"<br><br>"If it's true? That she was stupid enough to go wandering around the city at night and probably got herself eaten."<br><br>"Allie!"<br><br>"What?" We ducked through the broken door frame into the dank halls of the school. Rusty metal lockers were scattered along one wall, a few still standing, most dented and broken. I headed toward an upright one and yanked the door open with a squeak. "The vamps don't stay in their precious towers all the time. Sometimes they go hunting for live bodies. Everyone knows that." I grabbed the brush that I kept here to go with the mirror that was stuck to the back, the only useable one in the building. My reflection stared at me, a dirty-faced girl with straight black hair and "squinty eyes," as Rat put it. At least I didn't have teeth like a rodent.<br><br>I ran the brush through my hair, wincing at the snags. Stick was still watching me, disapproving and horrified, and I rolled my eyes. "Don't give me that look, Stephen," I said, frowning. "If you're out past sundown and get tagged by a bloodsucker, that's your fault for not staying put or not paying attention." I replaced the brush and shut the locker with a bang. "Gracie thought that just because she's Registered and her brother guards the Wall, she was safe from vampires. They always come for you when you think you're safe."<br><br>"Marc is pretty torn up about it," Stick said almost sullenly. "Gracie was his only family since their parents died."<br><br>"Not our problem." I felt bad for saying it, but it was true. In the Fringe, you looked out for yourself and your immediate family, no one else. My concern didn't extend beyond myself, Stick and the rest of our small gang. <em>This</em> was my family, screwed up as it was. I couldn't worry about the trials of everyone in the Fringe. I had plenty of my own, thanks.<br><br>"Maybe..." Stick began, and hesitated. "Maybe she's...hap-pier now," he continued. "Maybe being Taken into the Inner City is a good thing. The vampires will take better care of her, don't you think?"<br><br>I resisted the urge to snort. <em>Stick, they're vampires,</em> I wanted to say. <em>Monsters. They only see us as two things: slaves and food. Nothing good comes from a bloodsucker, you know that.</em><br><br>But telling Stick that would only upset him more, so I pretended not to hear. "Where are the others?" I asked as we walked down the hall, picking our way over rubble and broken glass. Stick trailed morosely, dragging his feet, kicking bits of rock and plaster with every step. I resisted the urge to smack him. Marc was a decent guy; even though he was Registered, he didn't treat us Unregistereds like vermin, and even spoke to us on occasion when he was making his rounds at the Wall. I also knew Stick had feelings for Gracie, though he would never act on them. But I was the one who shared most of my food with him, since he was usually too scared to go scavenging by himself. Ungrateful little snot. I couldn't watch out for everyone; he knew that.<br><br>"Lucas isn't back yet," Stick finally mumbled as we came to my room, one of the many empty spaces along the hall. In the years I had been here, I'd fixed it up the best I could. Plastic bags covered the shattered windows, keeping out the rain and damp. An old mattress lay in one corner with my blanket and pillow. I'd even managed to find a folding table, a couple chairs and a plastic shelf for various clutter, little things I wanted to keep. I'd built a nice little lair for myself, and the best part was my door still locked from the inside, so I could get some privacy if I wanted.<br><br>"What about Rat?" I asked, pushing on my door.<br><br>As the door squeaked open, a wiry boy with lank brown hair jerked around, beady eyes widening. He was older than me and Stick, with sharp features and a front tooth that stuck out like a fang, giving him a permanent sneer.<br><br>Rat swore when he saw me, and my blood boiled. This was <em>my</em> space, my territory. He had no right to be here. "Rat," I snarled, bursting through the doorway. "Why are you snooping around my room? Looking for things to steal?"<br><br></p><h2>Bake Sale Murder (Lucy Stone Mysteries, No. 13)</h2><p>When Lucy Stone stumbles upon the dead body of Mimi, the annoying and whiny wife of local developer Frank Stanton, she launches her own investigation into the murder, a quest for the truth that makes the killer nervous and results in threatening notes.</p><p><b>Leslie Meier</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of over twenty Lucy Stone mysteries and has also written for Ellery Queen's <i>Mystery Magazine</i>.

Here is the stunning account of a modern seeker's quest to get beneath the legends that surround Anthony and to determine whether his extreme way of life has something to offer people in today's world. James Cowan's quest takes him to Egypt, to the monastery that still exists near the site of Anthony's hermitage, where he meets the monk who becomes his guide and mentor on the journey. <br><br>He comes to regard Anthony and the colorful men and women who shared his lifestyle in the fourth through seventh centuries with affection and awe&#x2014;their departure to the desert a flight from the status quo of the newly Christian empire in order to preserve the radical path to liberation they saw in Christian teaching. Our modern efforts toward liberation may look different from theirs, he concludes, but the ultimate goal is no different, and Anthony remains a luminous model for anyone who passionately seeks to know God.</p><p>James Cowan is the author of more than twenty books, including <i>Francis: A Saint's Way </i> and the best-selling <i>A Mapmaker's Dream</i>, for which he was awarded the Australian Literature Society's Gold Medal. He lives in Queensland, Australia.Anthony of Egypt, one of the great early saints, was an ascetic who, when Christianity was just another cult threatening the Roman way, spiritually and politically thumbed his nose at authority by retreating to the desert to live as a "society of one." Cowan personalizes Anthony's story, beginning at Anthony's monastery in the eastern Egyptian desert, which houses some of the world's earliest ascetic and mystical literature, and besides Anthony, he examines the saint's great biographer, Athanasius. In addition, Cowan recounts his own relations with Lazarus, who lives on Anthony's mountain and is referred to as the last anchorite. Lazarus helped Cowan better understand his own reasons for seeking desert solitude. As he unfolds his and Lazarus' story, Cowan places Anthony in the context of an ascetic history extending from the pre-Christian monks said to have inhabited caves by the Dead Sea to John Cassian, who introduced asceticism to Europe in the fifth century. Cowan's exposition of Christian spirituality as it was and could now be lived is wholly engrossing. <i>June Sawyers</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Very few people suspected, and even fewer actually knew, that the Duchess cuckolded him&#x2014;and almost gave him up&#x2014;for a gay playboy twenty years her junior.<br><br>Blond and slender, Jimmy Donahue was the archetypal post-war playboy. He could fly a plane, speak several languages, play the piano, and tell marvelous jokes. People loved him for his wit, charm and personality. The grandson of millionaire Frank W. Woolworth, Jimmy knew he would never need to work. Instead, he set about carving for himself a career of mischief. Some said evil. <br><br>Gay at a time when the homosexual act was still illegal, Jimmy was notorious within America&#x2019;s upper class, and loved to shock. Though press agents arranged for him to be seen with female escorts, his pursuits, until he met the Duchess of Windsor, were exclusively homosexual. He was thirty-five when he was befriended by the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1950. The Duchess was fifty-four, and despite the difference in age, there was an instant attraction. A burgeoning sexual relationship &#x2013; a perverse sort of love &#x2013; was formed between Jimmy and the Duchess. Together with the Duke, they became an inseparable trio, the closest of friends. As Jimmy had planned, the royal couple became obsessed with him.<br><br>With information from surviving contemporaries, <i>Dancing with the Devil </i>is the extraordinary tale of three remarkable people and their unique and twisted relationship.<br></p><p>It shouldn't be a fascinating read, this book--it really shouldn't. It's just higher gossip about how Wallis Simpson took a younger lover after her marriage to Edward, and how she and said lover enjoyed nights of "nonpenetrative and principally oral sex." I mean, who cares? Shouldn't our minds be on higher things?<p> The trouble is, it's all absolutely fascinating. The lover was the mad, bad, and dangerous-to-know Jimmy Donahue: grandson of Woolworth's founder Frank W. Woolworth, heir to millions, and considered to be dashingly good-looking. (From the photos in the book, he looks a bit like a baby-faced bore, but maybe having those millions in the bank skewed perceptions of him, somewhat.) Donahue could fly a plane, could speak several languages, was a marvelous raconteur, and, on top of all this, was a promiscuous homosexual. That didn't stop him from forming a passionate friendship with Wallis, however, that soon turned into more than mere friendship. Wilson suggests that this constituted, on Wallis's part, perhaps "the greatest betrayal in history." Edward gave up his throne and kingdom for the woman he loved, only to have her take off with another man. However, it was never quite so simple as this. Edward didn't want a normal sexual relationship with Wallis, really--he got all of the satisfaction he wanted from playing with her feet--while she evidently continued to adore him, even if she found that the need for sexual satisfaction drove her into Donahue's arms. It might even have been that Edward knew, but didn't mind. The whole thing reads like some kind of royal soap opera, and, as such, it's absolutely riveting. <i>--Christopher Hart, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Christopher Wilson is an English journalist, broadcaster and author.

Fukuyama also demonstrates that, with liberty and equality at its heart, liberal democracy can accommodate the human need for recognition.</p><p>Francis Fukuyama was born in Chicago in 1952. His work includes America at the Crossroads: Democracy, Power, and the Neoconservative Legacy and After the Neo Cons: Where the Right went Wrong. He now lives in Washington D.C. with his wife and children, where he also works as a part time photographer.In 1989, The National Interest published ``The End of History?'' by Fukuyama, then a senior official at the State Department. In that comparatively short but extremely controversial article, Fukuyama speculated that liberal democracy may constitute the ``end point of mankind's ideological evolution'' and hence the ``final form of human government.'' Now Fukuyama has produced a brilliant book that, its title notwithstanding, takes an almost entirely new tack. To begin with, he examines the problem of whether it makes sense to posit a coherent and directional history that would lead the greater part of humanity to liberal democracy. Having answered in the affirmative, he assesses the regulatory effect of modern natural science, a societal activity consensually deemed cumulative as well as directional in its impact. Turning next to a ``second, parallel account of the historical process,'' Fukuyama considers humanity's struggle for recognition, a concept articulated and borrowed (from Plato) by Hegel. In this context, he goes on to reinterpret culture, ethical codes, labor, nationalism, religion, war, and allied phenomena from the past, projecting ways in which the desire for acknowledgement could become manifest in the future. Eventually, the author addresses history's presumptive end and the so-called ``last man,'' an unheroic construct (drawn from Tocqueville and Nietzsche) who has traded prideful belief in individual worth for the civilized comforts of self-preservation. Assuming the prosperity promised by contemporary liberal democracy indeed come to pass, Fukuyama wonders whether or how the side of human personality that thrives on competition, danger, and risk can be fulfilled in the sterile ambiance of a brave new world. At the end, the author leaves tantalizingly open the matter of whether mankind's historical journey is approaching a close or another beginning; he even alludes to the likelihood that time travelers may well strike out in directions yet undreamt. An important work that affords significant returns on the investments of time and attention required to get the most from its elegantly structured theme. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Might there he a code of ethics in the animal kingdom? Must an animal be human to he humane? In this provocative book, a renowned scientist takes on those who have declared ethics uniquely human Making a compelling case for a morality grounded in biology, he shows how ethical behavior is as much a matter of evolution as any other trait, in humans and animals alike. </p><p> World famous for his brilliant descriptions of Machiavellian power plays among chimpanzees-the nastier side of animal life--Frans de Waal here contends that animals have a nice side as well. Making his case through vivid anecdotes drawn from his work with apes and monkeys and holstered by the intriguing, voluminous data from his and others' ongoing research, de Waal shows us that many of the building blocks of morality are natural: they can he observed in other animals. Through his eyes, we see how not just primates but all kinds of animals, from marine mammals to dogs, respond to social rules, help each other, share food, resolve conflict to mutual satisfaction, even develop a crude sense of justice and fairness. </p><p> Natural selection may be harsh, but it has produced highly successful species that survive through cooperation and mutual assistance. De Waal identifies this paradox as the key to an evolutionary account of morality, and demonstrates that human morality could never have developed without the foundation of fellow feeling our species shares with other animals. As his work makes clear, a morality grounded in biology leads to an entirely different conception of what it means to he human--and humane. </p></p><p>In <i>Good Natured</i> Frans de Waal, ethologist and primatologist, asks us to reconsider human morality in light of moral aspects that can be identified in animals. Within the complex negotiations of human society, a moral action may involve thoughts and feelings of guilt, reciprocity, obligation, expectations, rules, or community concern. De Waal finds these aspects of morality prevalent in other animal societies, mostly primate, and suggests that the two philosophical camps supporting nature and nurture may have to be disbanded in order to adequately understand human morality. A theoretician, de Waal is meticulous in his research, cautious not to extrapolate too much from his findings, and logically sound in his arguments. He also writes with precision and a flair for the dramatic, carrying readers along with graceful ease and vivid examples.<b>Frans B. M. de Waal</b> is C. H.

Tells the story of Gods plan of salvation from creation through the life, death and resurrection of Christ. Helps children see Gods plan for their lives. Includes a salvation prayer and page for child and parent to sign and date regarding their decision.</p></p><p>While Christian parents agree that helping children to understand who God is is of the utmost importance, many struggle to find the words to explain the gospel to them. John MacArthur has successfully written a concise yet complete account of the gospel message in <i>I Believe in Jesus</i>, written entirely for young minds and hearts. With stirring watercolor illustrations from Melinda MacArthur, the author's daughter, <i>I Believe in Jesus</i> will hold the attention of little ones as well as communicate the most important message they will ever hear. Beginning at creation and moving through to eternity, MacArthur speaks directly to children in simple language by bringing theology (even tough subjects like the trinity) to a basic level. Pointed questions that ask, "Have you ever noticed how hard it is to always be good, kind, loving, and unselfish?" point out the child's need for a savior, while insightful answers give hope to young readers, saying, "Our sins should keep us out of heaven, but instead, God invites everyone--you too!--to come to Him and ask for forgiveness for our sins." As the child matures, he or she will begin to understand the Word of God in accordance with the childlike explanation coupled with it. This is sure to bring understanding that leads to wisdom (and hopefully repentance!) rather than the knowledge of a good story. The Word of God is trusted in this short story to change the hearts of children, hoping to usher them into His kingdom at a young, blessed age. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>JOHN F.

A man of wit, some people thought, he had erected a big red-and-white sign on the highway at the city limits:WELCOME TO RIO SECO HOME OF 3,000 FRIENDLY PEOPLE--AND THREE OLD CRANKS!Farther inside the city limits, half-hidden between a Ford billboard and one for Pepsi-Cola, he had placed another sign:THIS IS GOD'S COUNTRY DON'T DRIVE THROUGH IT LIKE HELLThis cattle, sheep, and farming town was much the same as fifty others dotted along the interminable east-west highways which speed traffic across the great monotonous stretches of western Texas ranch country. To an impatient motorist hunting a cooler place to light before dark, these dusty little towns are all cut from the same tiresome pattern and, despite the signboard, a long way from heaven.Like most of them, Rio Seco had old roots. It had been born out of necessity, a trading place for sprawling cow outfits, for scattered sheep camps and industrious German dryland farmers who had come west with their wagons, their plows, and a compulsive will to build something. The town long ago had made its growth and found its natural level. Now it held steady, gaining no ground but losing none. Oil companies had come and punched their holes and found them dry. They had gone again, leaving dreams of quick riches to drift away on the arid wind like the cotton-white clouds that promised rain and failed to deliver.Life still depended on two fundamentals: crops planted by the hand of man and grass planted by the hand of God.<i>Give us rain</i>, they said at Rio Seco, <i>and it makes no difference who is in the White House</i>.If one thing set the town apart, it was probably the trees--pale-green mesquites and massive, gnarled live oaks, rustling cottonwoods and shady pecans, watered by a hundred windmills whose towers stood tall above a timid skyline. Modern municipal mains provided purer water for drinking and cooking, but most of the older generation clung to wells for yards and gardens and trees. For a man who has often turned his face to the hot breath of drouth, the sight of a windmill tower--its big steel fan clanking patiently and pumping up water clear and cool--somehow reaches deep and touches something in his soul.The town had three cultures--Anglo, German, andMexican. The first two had largely merged through the years--beef and beans and apple strudel. The third remained unassimilated, except perhaps in Rio Seco's unhurried pace of living. Most of the Anglos were addicted to Mexican food, and most of the Mexicans loved football, but these were superficial things.Many of the older rock homes had a no-nonsense squared-off solidity the Germans had brought from their original settlements in the Pedernales River section of the hill country. Across the railroad tracks, beyond roads dusty from passage of livestock trucks on their way to the shipping pens, lay the Mexican part of town--ageless adobes and small frame shacks, and a fair number of modern GI houses built since the war. The old and the new stood side by side in sharp contrast: a wrinkled, ancient Mexican working up adobe bricks out of straw and mud in a barefoot method known to the fathers of his grandfathers, while next door a three-man crew with electric saws cut raw lumber for a new frame house. Two small brown-faced boys sat on a forebearing Mexican burro, their black eyes alive with curiosity as they watched an older brother tuning the motor of a hotrod.For the ranchman, business centered around Emmett Rodale's old stone bank and Jim Sweet's feedstore-wool warehouse, a long, cool, cavernous building of concrete tile. There in round, well-packed jute bags wedged between steel poles and stacked nearly to the high ceiling lay stored the gray-white fleeces that for three generations had been a cornerstone of Rio Seco's economy.For the farmer, business focused on the same bank, the cotton gin and a small grain elevator with twin steel tubes that stood taller than anything else in town except the sun-catching silver water tower emblazoned with crudely painted red letters: SRS '51.In the second floor of the rock-fronted courthouse was a room which in recent years had emerged as another important economic fact of life: the county office of the federal PMA. Next to rain, perhaps, it had become the <i>most</i>important fact. Here the man of the land came to declare his crop acreage, his past year's plantings. Here he was told how much land he would be allowed to seed in cotton, in grain sorghums, in whatever other crops might be under federal control. Here he came for price support and to receive checks to help him pay for terraces and water-spreading, for water wells and surface tanks, for battling back the prickly pear and thorny mesquite.Here he sold his freedom bit by bit, and was paid for it on the installment plan.March Nicholson, the county PMA officer, stood at the open window, looking down on the freshly mowed courthouse lawn, the buried sprinkler system showering green bermuda grass dotted by patches of dying winter rye. It always irritated him the way people parked haphazardly around the courthouse curb, ignoring the town ordinances, if indeed there were any. Across the street under a live-oak tree, half blocking the driveway to Nicholson's rented home, stood a pickup truck with a Hereford cow tied in the sideboarded bed and a saddled horse in an open-topped trailer hitched behind it. Horse droppings had tumbled over the tailgate and onto the ground; Nicholson would have to use his shovel tonight. He cursed under his breath. In the back of another pickup waited two Border Collie sheepdogs, resting but alert-eyed, watching a farmer pull up in a bobtail truck with two big tractor tires and several sacks of planting seed.Nicholson's baleful eye was pulled away from the horse droppings by a brush-scarred green pickup pulling into an open parking space."Well, I'll be damned. I wish you'd look who's come to the meeting."His district supervisor pushed to his feet from a chair in the courtroom's jury box where he had slouched to read a copy of the morning San Angelo paper. He watched a heavy, graying ranchman step out of the pickup and limp up the concrete sidewalk toward the front steps of the courthouse. He saw nothing which made that man lookdifferent from the couple of dozen stockmen and farmers already gossiping in the courtroom."I don't know him. Is he somebody special?""He's Charlie Flagg."The name meant nothing to the supervisor. "One of the rich ones?" he guessed. In this part of the country it was often hard to tell the rich man from the poor one by looking at him. The rich man was as likely to be wearing patched trousers and runover boots as the most destitute Mexican cowboy in town. One could not afford to put up a front and the other did not have to.Nicholson shook his head. "No, not rich. Charlie Flagg is one of those operators in the middle ground ... smaller than a lot of them. You've seen that sign on the edge of town, the one about the three old cranks? Charlie Flagg is Crank Number One."The supervisor watched the ranchman pause on the front steps to swap howdies with a deputy sheriff. The deputy, who probably did not swing a leg across a horse's back twice a year, was dressed in a neatly tailored Western shirt and tight-legged cowboy pants, shiny high-heeled boots and a nicely creased Stetson hat. The rancher, probably on horseback half his waking hours, wore a nondescript straw hat beaten badly out of shape and a pair of old black boots, his baggy khaki trousers stuffed carelessly into their tops. There was a lesson in this somewhere, the supervisor thought; someday he was going to reason it out."Gives you trouble, does he, March?""No trouble ... or anything else. Never sticks his hard head into my office. He's one of those old mosshorns who thinks he made it all by himself and he doesn't need anybody. I've tried to get him to go into some of our programs. You ought to hear him snort. Says the government didn't help him when he was getting started and he doesn't need it now.""Then I'd simply forget about him if I were you. Some people you can't change; you just have to outlive them.""Charlie Flagg is too contrary to die; he'll outlive us all."Nicholson's face twisted as he looked at the men who sat in little groups scattered around the big courtroom, talking weather and crops and prices. He had sent out five hundred postcards announcing the meeting; this looked like about all the crowd he was going to get."It's frustrating," he complained. "A man devotes his life to service, and this is the response they give him. Sometimes I wish I was selling cars in San Antonio."The supervisor said, "The rest'll come in when it's time to get their checks."Nicholson walked down the aisle and out into the hallway to see if there were any laggards. He saw Charlie Flagg come up the steps, laboring a little because of a slightly game leg. Part of a postcard stuck out of one shirt pocket. Nicholson shoved his hand forward. "Mister Flagg, when I sent you that card I had no hope you would actually come to the meeting."Flagg gripped Nicholson's hand hard enough to bring a stab of pain, but he looked puzzled. "Meetin'? What meetin'?""The meeting to explain the changes in the farm program."Flagg shrugged his heavy shoulders. "They change the farm program the way I change socks. Before you can get your meetin' over with, they'll be callin' you from Washington to tell you it's all different."Nicholson sagged a little. "You didn't come for the meeting, then?"Flagg shook his head. "I come up huntin' the judge. They sent me a call for jury duty and I got a shearin' crew comin' tomorrow. Court can wait, but a shearin' crew won't."Nicholson saw that the postcard in Flagg's pocket was not the one he had mailed. "Well, I still say you'll be in to see me someday, Mister Flagg."Flagg's gaze was steady and without compromise. "What I can't do for myself, I'll do without."A short, stocky ranchman came up the stairs in time to catch the last of it. He paused to spit a long stream of brown tobacco juice at a hallway cuspidor, getting most of it in. "You're preachin' again, Charlie," he grinned, "and this ain't even church."Charlie Flagg turned, a little embarrassed. "Hello, Rounder. I didn't go to preach, but he asked me and I told him."Rounder Pike laid a rough hand on Flagg's shoulder. "You're fartin' against the wind, Charlie. We've got used to government money like a kid gets used to candy. Most people wouldn't quit takin' it now. Them as did would go right on payin' the same old taxes and not get nothin' back. We're like a woman that's been talked into a little taste of sin and found out she likes it. You'd just as well join the crowd. You're payin' the freight anyway.""Never."<i>"Never</i> is an awful long time." Pike gripped Flagg's shoulder, then walked on into the courtroom.Nicholson motioned toward the door. "There's plenty of room, Mister Flagg."Flagg started to turn away. "You'll find, Mister Nicholson, that ranchers are contrary people. And <i>old</i> ranchers are <i>awful</i> contrary." He limped down the hall toward the office of the county judge.Nicholson's supervisor had come out into the hallway to listen. He said, "One of those <i>rugged individualists,</i> isn't he?""Someday he'll just be a <i>ragged</i> individualist. He's standing still while time goes on by. But he'll be in to see me one of these days. He'll come in like all the rest."The supervisor frowned, watching the rancher go through an open door. "Somehow, I hope he never does."Nicholson's eyebrows went up.The supervisor said, "He's gone out of style, but theworld will be a poorer place when it loses the last of his kind.""You sympathize with him?""I pity him, a little. A man can get awfully lonesome standing out there all by himself."Copyright � 1973, 1984 by Elmer Kelton</p><h2>The Wycherly Woman</h2><p>Phoebe Wycherly was missing two months before her wealthy father hired Archer to find her. That was plenty of time for a young girl who wanted to disappear to do so thoroughly--or for someone to make her disappear. Before he can find the Wycherly girl, Archer has to deal with the Wycherly woman, Phoebe&#39;s mother, an eerily unmaternal blonde who keeps too many residences, has too many secrets, and leaves too many corpses in her wake.</p><p><b>Ross Macdonald</b>&#x2019;s real name was Kenneth Millar. Born near San Francisco in 1915 and raised in Ontario, Millar returned to the US as a young man and published his first novel in 1944. He served as the president of the Mystery Writers of America and was awarded their Grand Master Award as well as the Mystery Writers of Great Britain's Gold Dagger Award. He died in 1983.THE WYCHERLY WOMAN is a classic noir puzzle, and Grover Gardner is ideal as the iconic Lew Archer, Bay Area gumshoe of the hard-boiled kind. Almost nothing is as it seems when Lew is hired by Homer Wycherly to find his college-age daughter, who has disappeared following her ill-matched parents&#39; messy divorce. Gardner gives distinctive voice to each of Macdonald&#39;s many hussies, blackmailers, wackos, and minor characters with colorful quirks by using subtle shifts of pitch and timbre, so you always know who is speaking. The genre is dated, and the MacGuffin is strictly unbelievable, but you won&#39;t care; Gardner keeps it tense, dramatic, and thoroughly entertaining, his performance a perfect match for Macdonald&#39;s pace and style.

He has researched and written widely on European (especially British) cultural history during the age of the Enlightenment. His books include <i>Ladies of the Grand Tour</i> and <i>Exploring European Frontiers</i>.Wedgwood pottery was one of the modern world's first brand names, prized first for its elegance by aristocrats who paid top prices for the company's exclusive, high-end wares, then eagerly purchased in mass-produced quantities by "the middling People" who sought to mimic refined tastes. The man who gave the name Wedgwood its cachet built one of England's earliest factories and devised marketing strategies still employed today by companies trying to cash in on -- or create -- a trend. Brian Dolan's knowledgeable biography of Josiah Wedgwood emphasizes his story's contemporary business resonances, from the subtitle using "tycoon," a word unknown to the book's 18th-century protagonist, to a quote in the epilogue from Donald Trump explaining why Wedgwood would have been "honored" to be called one. <p> Fortunately the author also carefully sketches the social, intellectual and economic climate of an age very different from our own, though it was changing rapidly when Josiah -- as the author calls him throughout -- was born in 1730. His family had been potters in the Staffordshire village of Burslem for more than a century, but his grandfather and father had let their small pottery works languish. They continued to make "old fashioned peasant pottery" while another branch of the family prospered by seizing on the innovations of Dutch immigrants to the area to produce glazed, finely shaped objects that were far more popular. His father died when Josiah was 9; his older brother Thomas inherited the struggling business. Josiah spent five years as an apprentice to his unimaginative sibling before striking out on his own.</p><p> Tracing Wedgwood's journeyman years, when he gained stature as a skilled potter tinkering with elements and chemicals to create attractive new glazes, Dolan does a nice job of explaining the trade's technical aspects to the lay reader. The author, who has written several previous books on 18th-century culture, links Wedgwood's faith in scientific experimentation as a path to profits with his religious background. Like almost all of the entrepreneurs who fired the Industrial Revolution, Wedgwood was a Dissenter, a member of one of the Protestant sects that believed "that God's handiwork was best understood through rational enquiry rather than . . . biblical exegesis." Excluded from elite universities and government service because of both their faith and their class, these men were open to new ways of thinking and acting; for them, self-education and self-improvement would lead to better business practices, better products, even a better society.</p><p> In Wedgwood's case, this meant taking the elegant green glaze he developed at age 28 and using it to persuade his more successful cousins to set him up in his own pottery works. Then he rode the tidal wave of enthusiasm for tableware imprinted with pictures and words by devising a smooth white glaze that made a perfect background. At 33, he married his distant cousin Sally, having become successful enough to meet her well-off father's stiff financial terms. Her substantial dowry enabled him to expand and take more risks. The biggest such gamble paid off splendidly in 1763, when he won a competition to provide Queen Charlotte with a tea service. Its elegant lines and creamy finish sparked feverish demand from the aristocracy, which beat a trail to Wedgwood's humble business and ordered more than enough "cream ware" to pay for the expensive experiments that had produced it.</p><p> Wedgwood maximized his returns on the craze by offering discounts for up-front payments from the expanding overseas market and warning his representative in London, whose patrician residents were notoriously slow to pay their bills, "I do not want these great folks to know that the Potters ever do give any credit at all." He plowed his profits into a brand-new factory built to his own design. Knowing that the fad for cream ware would pass, Wedgwood took advantage of his access to the nobility to spot cultural currents and garner publicity-making commissions. Lady Jane Cathcart, sister of the British envoy to Naples, introduced him to the pottery recently excavated from Pompeii; by the time every wealthy "neoclassical" enthusiast had to have an Etruscan vase at home, Wedgwood had created colored jasper, the perfect substance for reproducing them. Lady Cathcart's husband, the British ambassador to Russia, wangled a commission from Catherine the Great for a dining service; when Wedgwood displayed it in his London showroom (another marketing innovation), crowds gathered to ogle both the sensationally decorated objects and the aristocratic patrons.</p><p> His closest friends remained the fellow Dissenters and political liberals who were so vividly depicted in Jenny Uglow's 2002 group portrait, The Lunar Men: Five Friends Whose Curiosity Changed the World. Though Dolan lacks Uglow's gift for thumbnail characterizations and rich atmosphere, his biography is more focused and accessible than her thickly detailed work. Writing at more of a distance from his subject, scrutinizing Wedgwood's business practices and ideology more closely than his personality, Dolan is better positioned to assess his faults as well as his virtues.</p><p> A belief in a rational, steadily improving universe sustained Wedgwood through the childhood deaths of two of his eight offspring, the amputation (without anesthesia) of a diseased leg and an agonizing death at age 64 from an infected jaw. It also inspired the stringent management of his factory, which was "run like a military regime" by a boss who might provide housing, education, training and even health care and retirement plans (Dolan does not give details about these) but also started the workday with a bell, kept track of employees' hours and bemoaned "dilatory, drunken, Idle, worthless workmen." Dolan legitimately admires Wedgwood's achievements as a merchandiser and manufacturer but also acknowledges that the Industrial Revolution looked rather different to his labor force than it did to him. In our own time, remade with equal comprehensiveness by globalization, that's an important caveat to keep in mind. </p><p>Reviewed by Wendy Smith <br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Why? First, because its author, the youth who called General (and afterward President) Washington his father, the youth who was the grandson of First Lady Martha Washington, knew intimately the Great Patriot s family and life: </p><p>"Concerning [Washington s] domestic habits and manners; the routine of his methodical life; what he said and did, when he retired from public cares and duties, in the evening of his glorious day, I ought to know much. Taken from my orphaned cradle to his paternal arms, nourished at his board, cherished in his bosom, from childhood to manhood, I ought to know something of the First President of the United States, and the illustrious Farmer of Mount Vernon. </p><p>So, over the years, George Washington Parke Custis wrote it all down, everything he could remember about his father, the Father of our Country. What Mr. Custis couldn't remember himself, he got directly from family and friends, all former associates of Washington. Mr. Custis tells us of two: </p><p>"Bishop, [Washington s] military servant and humble friend in the war of '55-56, who helped him to his last horse on the field of Braddock, when death gathered so many sheaves to the garner --- the veteran Bishop died at Mount Vernon at a very advanced age. It was while sitting upon his knee, in the days of my childhood, that I often heard the old man relate the events of the Indian wars, and have seen him raise his withered arm, while his faded eye lighted up, when describing the memorable and heroic achievements of his patron and commander." </p><p>Dr. James Craik, also. He and Washington were comrades and fellow-captives at the affair of the Meadows, in '55; were associated in the War of the Revolution, and bosom friends. </p><p>When Mr. Custis died in 1857, his daughter collected and arranged for publishing the Recollections and Private Memoirs of George Washington, careful not to alter her father s text. </p><p>It s truly a history bonanza.

A year before, a stunning Swedish student disappeared from Oxfordshire, leaving behind a rucksack with her identification. As the lady was dishy, young, and traveling alone, the Thames Valley Police suspected foul play. But without a body, and with precious few clues, the investigation ground to a halt. Now it seems that someone who can hold back no longer is composing clue-laden poetry that begins an enthusiastic correspondence among England's news-reading public. Not one to be left behind, Morse writes a letter of his own--and follows a twisting path through the Wytham Woods that leads to a most shocking murder.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Colin Dexter has won many awards for his novels including the CWA Gold Dagger and Silver Dagger awards. In 1997 he was presented with the CWA Cartier Diamond Dagger Award for outstanding services to crime literature. Colin&#39;s thirteenth and final Inspector Morse novel, The Remorseful Day, was published in 1999. He lives in Oxford.Winner of the Crime Writers&#39; Association (UK) Gold Dagger Award, this entry in the Inspector Morse series offers clues to the disappearance of a Swedish student through a riddle in verse. Lovers of crosswords and literary quotations will relish this complex case. &#34;Morse&#34; comes alive through Michael Pennington&#39;s presentation of the wry police inspector. His speech patterns perfectly capture Morse--that &#34;conceited, civilized, boozy, sensitive man.&#34; Touches of bitterness, sarcasm and impatience are wonderfully conveyed through tone and inflection. Pennington seems to neatly capture the author&#39;s voice. The dialogue is lively, and Morse and Sergeant Lewis could entertain the listener indefinitely. R.F.W.

So begins the story of Patricia Polacco's mother's favorite doll.</p><p>Whenever Mary Ellen needed Betty Doll, she was there. She survived blizzards and thunderstorms, attended parties and weddings, and helped mourn the deaths of old friends. From the day Trisha's mother first sewed Betty Doll together stitch by stitch, to the day, many years later, when she discovered she had cancer, her soft, sweet Betty Doll was there. Now Betty Doll lives on in Patricia Polacco's soft, beautiful artwork as Trisha shares the warm and poignant moments of her mother's favorite doll with readers of all ages.</p><p></p></p><p>Young Mary Ellen is heartbroken when her family's farmhouse burns to the ground, taking all five of her dolls with it. So when her mother announces that they are going to make her a new doll, she is overjoyed. But little does she know that Betty Doll will travel with her as her closest confidant through her whole life, watching as first Mary Ellen grows up, then her children, and her grandchildren. Along the way, Betty is privy to family events big and small: a devastating blizzard, tea parties, weddings, floods, illness, births, deaths, and war. When a much older Mary Ellen discovers she has cancer, she writes a letter to her grown daughter, Tricia, telling her the story of Betty Doll, and passing on her own abiding love for Tricia.<p> Tricia, or Patricia Polacco, has shared the words of the letter in this touching tribute to her mother, with black and white (with splashes of color) sketches that reflect the time span from the early 1900s to the present. Polacco often plumbs the depths of her family history for picture book ideas. She is the author of <i>Chicken Sunday</i>, <i>The Butterfly</i>, and many other warm tales. (Ages 5 to 9) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>"I was born in Lansing, Michigan in 1944. Soon after my birth I lived in Williamston, Michigan and then moved onto my grandparents farm in Union City, Michigan.<p>"I lived on the farm with my mom and Grandparents until 1949. That is when my Babushka (my grandmother) died and we prepared to move away from Michigan. I must say that living on that little farm with them was the most magical time of my life...and that my Babushka and other grandparents were some of the most inspirational people in my life.</p><p>"My parents were divorced when I was 3, and both my father and mother moved back into the homes of their parents. I spent the school year with my mother, and the summers with my dad. In both households I was the apple of my grandparents' eyes! I would say that these relationships with my grandparents have most definitely influenced my life and my work. You probably have noticed that in almost every book that I write there is a very young person who is interacting with an elderly person. Personally, I feel that this is the most valuable experience of my life....having the wonder of knowing both children and elderly people.</p><p>"The respect that I learned as a very young person certainly carried over into my life in later years.

I spent the school year with my mother, and the summers with my dad. In both households I was the apple of my grandparents' eyes! I would say that these relationships with my grandparents have most definitely influenced my life and my work.

Stardate 6012.9.<br> <br>The Enterprise has concluded a successful week charting the Wyvern system, a region devoid of intelligent life but full of fascinating planets, moons, asteroid belts, and radiation fields, or so my first officer informs me. In the meantime, with no immediate crisis on the horizon, the crew is looking forward to some much-needed recreation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mister Spock,&#x201d; Lieutenant Uhura said. &#x201c;Do you have a minute?&#x201d;<br> <br>The Vulcan science officer looked up from his scanner. &#x201c;At our present cruising speed, we are not expected to arrive at Starbase 13 for another 72.03 hours. You have my attention for as many minutes as you require. How can I assist you?&#x201d;<br> <br>It was a relatively quiet moment on the bridge. The U.S.S. Enterprise was cruising at warp 2 through the interstellar void, with the Wyvern system receding in the ship&#x2019;s aft sensors. Captain James T. Kirk listened casually to the conversation behind him as he reviewed the latest maintenance reports from engineering. A yeoman offered him a fresh cup of coffee, which he gratefully accepted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I doubt this will take 72.03 hours,&#x201d; Uhura quipped. She wandered away from the communications station to confer with Spock at his post. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just organizing this year&#x2019;s holiday party, and I wanted your input.&#x201d;<br> <br>Spock arched an eyebrow. &#x201c;I am not certain that I am the appropriate officer to consult on such a matter. Levity is hardly the Vulcan way.&#x201d;<br> <br>That&#x2019;s putting it lightly, Kirk thought. He wondered what Uhura was about.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s what I wanted to ask you about,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;As usual, the holiday party embraces the varied cultures and traditions of the ship&#x2019;s entire crew, celebrating Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanza, Diwali, Ramadan, mololo zam, and the Saturnian Blessing of the Rings, but I admit that I&#x2019;m not terribly familiar with the customs of your people, Mister Spock. Are there any Vulcan holidays or rituals you would like us to include in the festivities?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk rotated the captain&#x2019;s chair around to observe Spock&#x2019;s science station. The general chatter on the bridge died down, the better to eavesdrop on this increasingly intriguing conversation. Kirk suspected that Chekov and Sulu and the rest of the bridge crew were listening in as well. Even though they had all been serving beside Spock for at least four years now, there was still much they didn&#x2019;t know about Vulcan life and customs. Spock, like the rest of his people, tended to be rather close-lipped on the subject.<br> <br>&#x201c;You need not trouble yourself on my behalf, Lieutenant,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;although you are to be applauded for your efforts at inclusiveness, which are very much in keeping with the Vulcan philosophy of IDIC.&#x201d;<br> <br>Infinite diversity in infinite combinations, Kirk translated mentally. He was quite familiar with the motto, which was one of the fundamental touchstones of Vulcan civilization. It had also been one of the guiding principles behind the formation of the Federation itself. No small surprise, considering that Vulcan, along with Earth, was a founding member of the UFP.<br> <br>&#x201c;So you never celebrated any holidays at home?&#x201d; Uhura pressed. &#x201c;Not even when you were growing up?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That is not entirely the case,&#x201d; Spock admitted. &#x201c;My father occasionally indulged my mother&#x2019;s fondness for certain Terran holidays, most notably the human custom of St. Valentine&#x2019;s Day.&#x201d;<br> <br>Uhura reacted with delight to this unexpected revelation. &#x201c;Why, Mister Spock, that&#x2019;s positively romantic!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;On the contrary,&#x201d; he stated, &#x201c;it is simply logical. In a universe populated by myriad species and cultures, respecting and accommodating each other&#x2019;s disparate traditions is the only rational response.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well said, Mister Spock,&#x201d; Kirk said, joining the discussion. &#x201c;I believe it was George Bernard Shaw who famously stated that a barbarian was someone who confused the customs of his own tribe with the laws of the universe. Or words to that effect.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk half expected Spock to make some gibe about humans being well equipped to comment on the topic of barbarism, but the Vulcan refrained, possibly because Doctor McCoy was not in earshot. Bones was presently holding down the fort in sickbay, dealing with an outbreak of Therbian fever among the crew, which meant there was nobody on the bridge to provoke.<br> <br>&#x201c;A most civilized sentiment,&#x201d; Spock said instead, &#x201c;particularly for an Earthman of his generation.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about you, Captain?&#x201d; Uhura asked. &#x201c;Can we expect you at the party?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Er, we&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; he hedged. After the Helen Noel incident a few years back, he was still a bit leery of holiday parties. Such celebrations were good for morale, but too much fraternization could lead to some awkward moments afterward. Thank goodness Helen eventually transferred over to the Reliant, he thought. &#x201c;It depends on what my schedule is looking like.&#x201d;<br> <br>Uhura wasn&#x2019;t going to let him off that easy.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure the whole crew is hoping you&#x2019;ll attend, sir. It wouldn&#x2019;t be the same without you.&#x201d;<br> <br>She had a point, he admitted. Maybe if he just made an appearance?<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I certainly wouldn&#x2019;t want to disappoint the crew&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>An urgent chime from the communications station interrupted him. Uhura hurried back to her post and adjusted her earpiece. All talk of parties and holidays was instantly put aside as she resumed her duties with her usual brisk professionalism.<br> <br>&#x201c;Captain,&#x201d; she reported urgently, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re receiving an emergency distress signal from Ephrata IV.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ephrata?&#x201d; he echoed. &#x201c;The Institute?&#x201d;<br> <br>It had to be. As far as he knew, there were no other colonies or settlements in the Ephrata system. Indeed, the Institute had chosen Ephrata IV because of its remote and isolated location, far from the hustle and bustle of more populated systems. Seclusion was considered more conducive to serious study and contemplation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Put it on the screen,&#x201d; he ordered.<br> <br>Uhura consulted her control panel and displays. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying, sir, but there&#x2019;s interference with the visual component of the signal. I&#x2019;m mostly getting audio only.&#x201d; She turned toward the main viewer at the front of the bridge. &#x201c;Coming through now.&#x201d;<br> <br>On the screen, a burst of visual snow replaced a view of the starry vista they had been traversing. The head and shoulders of a humanoid figure could be only dimly glimpsed through the chaff. A feminine voice, punctuated by static, cried out in obvious distress:<br> <br>&#x201c;Help us! This is the Ephrata Institute, requesting immediate assistance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Crackles and pops obscured the audio, so that only snippets could be heard. &#x201c;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. disaster&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. casualties&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gravity of the situation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk thought he recognized the voice. He leaned forward in his seat, trying in vain to make out the figure&#x2019;s features.<br> <br>&#x201c;Elena?&#x201d;<br> <br>Doctor Collins was an old family friend from Iowa who had often played bridge with his parents when Kirk was growing up. Last he heard, she had accepted a position as president of the Ephrata Institute. He couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time he&#x2019;d seen her in person. Probably at Sam&#x2019;s and Aurelan&#x2019;s funeral. As he recalled, she&#x2019;d come all the way from Alpha Centauri to attend his brother&#x2019;s and sister-in-law&#x2019;s memorial services on Deneva. Kirk had been touched by her thoughtfulness.<br> <br>&#x201c;Elena!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening? What&#x2019;s the nature of your emergency?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s no use, Captain,&#x201d; Uhura said. &#x201c;This signal was sent days ago. We&#x2019;re only just now receiving the signal.&#x201d; She fiddled with her controls. &#x201c;Unable to establish direct communication with Ephrata at this time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Keep trying.&#x201d;<br> <br>Frustration gnawed at Kirk. Out here on the final frontier, remote settlements like the one on Ephrata were often cut off from relief or communication for days, weeks, or even months at a time. For all he knew, the disaster at the Institute had come and gone&#x2014;and Elena and the other scholars were already dead or dying.<br> <br>&#x201c;Emergency!&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;Gravity&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the weight of worlds&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. help us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>The transmission ended abruptly. Nothing but snow and static filled the screen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uhura?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all, Captain.&#x201d; She hit a switch, and an endless sea of open space returned to the viewer. &#x201c;The signal appears to have been cut off at the source.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Understood.&#x201d; Kirk would have liked more information, but his course was clear. Their routine call on Starbase 13 would have to wait. &#x201c;Mister Sulu, set a course for Ephrata IV. Warp factor 6.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, aye, sir.&#x201d; The helmsman consulted the astrogator located at the helm and navigation stations. &#x201c;Estimated time to Ephrata system thirty-nine hours, seventeen minutes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Damn it, Kirk thought. He found himself wishing that the Institute had chosen a location somewhat less off the beaten track. &#x201c;Any chance that another vessel might have already responded to that distress signal?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Unlikely, Captain,&#x201d; Spock reported. &#x201c;As you know, Ephrata IV is isolated by design. The Enterprise is the only Federation starship in this sector, and the odds that a private or commercial vessel would be in their vicinity are roughly seven hundred sixty to one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was afraid of that,&#x201d; Kirk said. Aside from the typically precise probability, Spock hadn&#x2019;t told him anything he didn&#x2019;t already suspect. The Enterprise was probably the only chance those people had, if they were still alive to be rescued. He turned to his first officer for guidance. &#x201c;Your thoughts?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There is insufficient data to reach any definite conclusions,&#x201d; Spock said. He called up the latest reports and information on Ephrata from the ship&#x2019;s memory banks and swiftly reviewed the relevant material. &#x201c;The Ephrata Institute appears to have been thriving. There is no indication that the settlement was encountering any significant difficulties. A supply ship, the Yakima, visited the planet six months ago and reported nothing untoward. The Institute&#x2019;s primary output was academic papers and research studies.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And then what happened?&#x201d; Kirk wondered aloud. &#x201c;An epidemic? A natural disaster? An alien attack?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The last is improbable,&#x201d; Spock said. &#x201c;The Ephrata system is safely distant from the Klingon, Romulan, and Tholian borders. And the surrounding systems contain no potentially hostile species with warp capacity.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kirk wanted to believe him. &#x201c;What about some enemy unknown to us?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Always possible, Captain, but it is uncertain where precisely such a threat would originate.&#x201d; Spock eyed Kirk with concern, and a hint of compassion. &#x201c;I take it you know Doctor Collins?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; Kirk admitted, but did not elaborate. There would be time enough to fill in Spock and McCoy on his personal connection to this crisis; the rest of the crew didn&#x2019;t need to worry about their captain being emotionally compromised. Kirk stared at the distant stars ahead, mentally willing them nearer. Thirty-nine long hours stretched out before him. He briefly considered upping their speed to warp 7, even over Scotty&#x2019;s inevitable protests, but thought better of it. Warp 7 would place too great a strain on the ship and its resources, and they had no idea what they were in for once they reached Ephrata.

These peoples lived together, sometimes uneasily, sometimes at peace, forging the multiethnic cultures of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. The last two centuries have brought one army after another to the Baltic, led by Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm, Tsar Nicholas, Hitler's generals, and Stalin's field marshals. In the wake of World War II, the multiethnic cultures of the Baltic splintered, and millions of citizens, including Canadian historian Modris Eksteins, born in Latvia in 1943, were sent into flight.<p> Eksteins's narrative, haunted by ghosts and unconventional in structure, embraces many stories. At one level, he offers a requiem for the Baltic past. At another, he composes a personal history of his family, driven so far from its homeland. At yet another, he ponders the nature of history itself in a tale that "must reflect the loss of authority, of history as ideal and of the author-historian as agent of that ideal. What we are left with is the intimacy not of truth but of experience." The terrible experience of war and conflagration propels his beautifully rendered, eyes-wide-open narrative. During his childhood, Eksteins concludes, "for regret and tears there was no time, no point." Half a century later, he is able to mourn the loss of the old Baltic world--and readers of contemporary history will find much to think about as he does. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Modris Ekstein is a professor of history at the University of Toronto&#39;s Scarborough campus.</p><h2>Mr. Monk in Trouble</h2><p>America&#39;s favorite obsessive-compulsive detective is back in a new original tale in the series based on the popular TV show, in a book by the author of Mr. Monk and the Dirty Cop.

He shows how the long history of Shintoism is deeply woven into the fabric of Japanese spirituality and mythology--indeed, it is regarded as Japan's very spiritual roots--and discusses its role in modern Japan and the world. He also carefully analyzes the relationship of the spirit and the soul, which will provide informed and invaluable insight into how spirituality affects our daily existence. Through the author's emphasis on the universality of Shinto and its prevalence in the natural world, the book will appeal to all readers with an appreciation of humanity's place in nature and the individual's role in the larger society.</p><p><br><strong>Motohisa Yamakage</strong> was born in 1925 and brought up in an old Shintoist family. In 1956, he became the 79th Grand Master of Yamakage Shinto. Grand Master Yamakage has played a leading role in introducing Shinto to people around the world and many of his essays, translated into German, French, and English, have been published in leading European magazines. In 2005, Motohisa Yamakage retired and was succeeded by hisson, Hitoyoshi Yamakage.<br>Western visitors to Japan sometimes come away with the idea that Shinto, Japan's indigenous religion, is a "dead" tradition, with shrines preserved as mere historic sites or tourist traps. Not so, claims Yamakage, who represents "the 79th generation of an ancient Shinto tradition" and makes a case for living Shinto as a faith-based religion that is predicated on "the belief in the presence of the <i>kami</i>," or spirits. Yamakage calls for a return to <i>koshinto</i>, the ancient Shinto practice that he says had no shrines at all, and for a rejection of the "secular, materialistic, atheistic society" that he believes modern Japan has become. He offers a strong introduction to Shinto, stressing that it is nondogmatic, nondoctrinal and almost wholly decentralized. Still, Shintoists are united by a reverence for nature and an emphasis on self-purification, particularly through water rituals and cleansing. The book is nicely designed, with an excellent layout and black-and-white photos throughout. At times, Yamakage's voice can be overly strident, as when challenging the faith and motivations of some contemporary Shinto priests. Overall, however, this is a fine primer that makes a compelling case for Shinto as a religion invested with deep meaning. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But one day a gentle-eyed man passes by, pushed by a crowd, his hands tied. His kind gaze warms the bush in a way it has never experienced. Little does it know, it will be inextricably linked to this man for all time before the day is through. Soon, another man comes and cuts off some branches, and shortly thereafter, the gentle man returns, this time carrying a cross and wearing--can it be? Yes, on his head is a crown made from the dismal bush's thorns. The thornbush is ashamed of the pain its spikes cause, and refuses to bloom for two days. But on the third day, a woman runs through the streets, crying, "He's alive! Jesus is risen!" and the bush makes peace with its part in the terrible--and wondrous--events.<p> Seen through the eyes of a thornbush, this original perspective on the ancient story of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection has a fresh sweetness that will be welcomed by readers of any age. Richard Stergulz's rich paintings fill the pages with color and tenderness.

The present volume contains ten essays that provide an overview of Habermas's political thought since the original appearance of Between Facts and Norms in 1992 and extend his model of deliberative democracy in novel ways to issues untreated in the earlier work. Habermas's theory of democracy has at least three features that set it apart from competing positions. First, it combines a concern with questions of normative justification with an empirical analysis of the social conditions necessary for the realization of democratic institutions. Second, at the heart of his model is the assertion of an internal relationship between liberalism and democracy. On this account, the rights of the individual that are central to liberalism can be guaranteed only within a constitutional framework that at the same time fosters democratic rights of political participation through the public sphere. Finally, Habermas defends a conception of universal human rights that is not only sensitive to cultural differences but also calls for legal and political institutions that facilitate the cultivation of cultural and religious identities within pluralistic societies. These essays demonstrate the extraordinary power of Habermas's theory of democracy through a further engagement with Rawls's political liberalism and through original contributions to current debates over nationalism, multiculturalism, and the viability of supranational political institutions.</p></p><p>J�rgen Habermas is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of Frankfurt and Professor of Philosophy at Northwestern University.

A portrayal oftwo woman discovering an emotional rapport as they struggle against theconfines of a rigid caste system, Umrigar&#x2019;scaptivating second novel echoes the timeless intensity of ZoraNeale Hurston&#x2019;s <em>Their Eyes Were WatchingGod</em>, Betty Smith&#x2019;s <em>A Tree Grows inBrooklyn</em>, and Barbara Kingsolver&#x2019;s <em>ThePoisonwood Bible</em>&#x2014;a quintessential triumph of modern literary fiction.</p><p><i>The Space Between Us</i>, Thrity Umrigar's poignant novel about a wealthy woman and her downtrodden servant, offers a revealing look at class and gender roles in modern day Bombay. Alternatively told through the eyes of Sera, a Parsi widow whose pregnant daughter and son-in-law share her elegant home, and Bhima, the elderly housekeeper who must support her orphaned granddaughter, Umrigar does an admirable job of creating two sympathetic characters whose bond goes far deeper than that of employer and employee. <p> When we first meet Bhima, she is sharing a thin mattress with Maya, the granddaughter upon whom high hopes and dreams were placed, only to be shattered by an unexpected pregnancy and its disastrous consequences. As time goes on, we learn that Sera and her family have used their power and money time and time again to influence the lives of Bhima and Maya, from caring for Bhima's estranged husband after a workplace accident, to providing the funds for Maya's college education. We also learn that Sera's seemingly privileged life is not as it appears; after enduring years of cruelty under her mother-in-law's roof, she faced physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her husband, pain that only Bhima could see and alleviate. Yet through the triumphs and tragedies, Sera and Bhima always shared a bond that transcended class and race; a bond shared by two women whose fate always seemed to rest in the hands of others, just outside their control. </p><p> Told in a series of flashbacks and present day encounters, <i>The Space Between Us</i> gains strength from both plot and prose. A beautiful tale of tragedy and hope, Umrigar's second novel is sure to linger in readers' minds. <i>--Gisele Toueg</i></p><p>Each morning, Bhima, a domestic servant in contemporary Bombay, leaves her own small shanty in the slums to tend to another woman's house. In Sera Dubash's home, Bhima scrubs the floors of a house in which she remains an outsider. She cleans furniture she is not permitted to sit on. She washes glasses from which she is not allowed to drink. Yet despite being separated from each other by blood and class, she and Sera find themselves bound by gender and shared life experiences.</p><p>Sera is an upper-middle-class Parsi housewife whose opulent surroundings hide the shame and disappointment of her abusive marriage. A widow, she devotes herself to her family, spending much of her time caring for her pregnant daughter, Dinaz, a kindhearted, educated professional, and her charming and successful son-in-law, Viraf.</p><p>Bhima, a stoic illiterate hardened by a life of despair and loss, has worked in the Dubash household for more than twenty years. Cursed by fate, she sacrifices all for her beautiful, headstrong granddaughter, Maya, a university student whose education -- paid for by Sera -- will enable them to escape the slums. But when an unwed Maya becomes pregnant by a man whose identity she refuses to reveal, Bhima's dreams of a better life for her granddaughter, as well as for herself, may be shattered forever.</p><p>Poignant and compelling, evocative and unforgettable, The <em>Space Between Us</em> is an intimate portrait of a distant yet familiar world. Set in modern-day India and witnessed through two compelling and achingly real women, the novel shows how the lives of the rich and the poor are intrinsically connected yet vastly removed from each other, and vividly captures how the bonds of womanhood are pitted against the divisions of class and culture.</p></p><h2>Prime Evil</h2><p>This collection of twelve original horror tales includes contributions by such noted writers of the genre as Stephen King, Dennis Etchison, Clive Barker, Ramsey Campbell, Whitley Strieber, and Peter Straub</p><p><b>Douglas E.

The lead story, "The Night Flier," is by Stephen King but is one of the weakest in the book, a vampire tale with a long windup and a brief punch. "Having a Woman at Lunch" by Paul Hazel is a carefully written, ironic account of a group of diffident males who find a macabre way of dealing with a woman who infiltrates their circle. Clive Barker's "Coming to Grief" is one of this writer's quieter stories, which clearly shows the influence of Ramsey Campbell, himself represented by "Next Time You'll Know Me," about a homicidal paranoic for whom it is difficult not to feel sorry. "Food" by Thomas Tessier tells of an obese woman undergoing a metamorphosis and the unfortunate man who loves her. Other excellent contributions are by M.

Or you may recognize her from her starring roles on TV -- <i>The West Wing</i>, <i>Pushing Daisies</i>, <i>Sesame Street</i>...oh, and her Huge Hit Sitcom <i>Kristin</i> on NBC. (Huge hit.

At four foot eleven, Kristin Chenoweth is an immense talent in a petite but powerful package.</p><p>In this lively, laugh-out-loud book, Kristin shares her journey from Oklahoma beauty queen to Broadway leading lady, reflecting on how faith and family have kept her grounded in the dysfunctional rodeo of show biz. The daughter of an engineer and a nurse, Kristin was singing in front of thousands at Baptist conventions by age twelve and winning beauty pageants by age twenty-two. (Well, actually she was second runner-up almost every freaking time. But, hey, she's not bitter.) On her way to a career as a professional opera singer, she stopped in New York to visit a friend and went on a whim to an audition. Through a combination of talent, hard work, and (she's quick to add) the grace of God, Kristin took Broadway by storm. But of course, into every storm, the occasional drizzle of disaster must fall.</p><p>Filled with wit, wisdom, and backstage insight, <i>A Little Bit Wicked</i> is long on love and short on sleep; it's essential reading for Kristin's legions of fans and an uplifting story for anyone seeking motivation to follow his or her dreams -- over the rainbow and beyond.</p></p><p><b>Kristin Chenoweth </b>is an award-winning musical theatre performer, opera singer, television and film actress, and an exclusively signed Sony Masterworks recording artists.

A lot of big girls, too. A line of blushing attendants, all picture-pretty, clutch their bouquets of roses and baby's breath, each on the arm of a dashing, tuxedoed counterpart.

Then Jimmy showed up, and everything became a question. Now, here I am at the eleventh hour, wondering what might happen, who will I be, if I allow my passion to be swayed by this dangerous bad boy. Crystallized moments like this one arise in every woman's life. Moments of truth in which she makes the choices that guide her destiny. Moments that ultimately write the story of her.</p><p>Sugar or spice? I agonize. Naughty or nice?</p><p>Sensible angels whisper in my ear, but the runaway bride in me is getting restless. I am a type A "leap and a net will appear" risk-taker, and if I trust that God made me this way for a reason, then I have to believe that the risk will be worth it in the long run. Experience has taught me that we all stumble and fall; faith assures me that He'll be there to catch me when I do. My heart speaks, and I listen.</p><p>I chose Jimmy.</p><p>Jimmy Choo, that is. A fabulous pair of four-inch platform slingbacks. Setting aside the safe-and-sane character shoes I was planning to wear onstage tonight, I cast my lot with the bad boy. Oh, I know what you're thinking, and, yeah, it's not exactly <i>Sophie's Choice</i>. But this is Oscar night. I'm about to step out onstage in front of thousands of people -- friends, colleagues, peers, people I hope and dream of working with -- plus my parents and everyone else watching the live broadcast on television.</p><p>People keep reminding me that billions -- with a <i>b</i> as in <i>bombastic</i> and <i>boy howdy!</i> -- yes, <i>billions</i> of people all over the world will be tuned in. Even in the coziest venues, performers can and do get hurt onstage all the time. There's a broken toe for every light on Broadway. But I'm not as concerned for myself as I am for the burgeoning cast of backup dancers. This is a huge shot of r�sum� adrenaline for most of these kids; I don't want it to turn into some tragicomic YouTube video labeled "Cheno Falls on Ass." On the other hand, when you're four feet eleven inches you get pretty comfortable in heels.</p><p>"A nice pair of Jimmy Choos never hurt anyone," I tell my friend Denny, but I take the precaution of having the soles rubbered for slip-resistance.

Joining me on the sweeping two-story set is a village-size cast including half a dozen dancing brides niftily accessorized with dancing grooms, quick-stepping waiters, acrobatically inclined construction workers, happy townies, multiculti mariachis, and (putting us indisputably over the top) a marching band. Against a miniature backdrop of Manhattan, a battalion of gorgeous guys will form sort of a hunkpowered elevator and pass me bodily off an ornate, ten-foot-tall bridge.</p><p>A great song.

The problem is, I'm still in love with Mr. Writer, a man who is more likely to show up in a "Falls on Ass" video than an "Everlasting Love" commercial. Truth be told, eHarmony would not encourage me to share so much as a cab uptown with this guy. But of course this is precisely what makes him irresistible.</p><p>Never for a moment did I even fantasize that Aaron Sorkin was Mr. Right. From the day we met, he was Mr. Sets My Brain on Fire, then he evolved for a long, lovely spell into Mr. Makes Me Sing REO Speedwagon in the Shower, but there was always an undercurrent of Mr. You Are Seriously Pushing Your Luck Here, and I eventually found myself doing the ol' step-ball-change with Mr. Why Am I Banging My Head Against This Wall? Instead of coming up with a cutesy Hollywood powercouple name for us -- "Sorkoweth" or "Chenorkin" -- the tabloids wearily call us "on again/off again," which means we periodically put each other through a wrenching spate of separation, but I keep reinstating him as Mr. Might Actually Be Worth the Trouble. We are now "off again," and it's painful to not share this amazing moment with him. I love the man, and whatever happens or doesn't happen between us in the long run, I always will.</p><p>"It's in God's hands," I tell my father whenever he shakes his head about it.</p><p>The only thing I can say with utter certainty is that come what may, my feelings for George Clooney will remain unsullied.

His wry, wisenheimer humor is good medicine for our cruel but tenderhearted community.</p><p>"Welcome to the makeup sex," he said at the start of the show, and I felt a twinge of knowing exactly what he was talking about.</p><p>Aside from my periodic reunions with Mr. If Loving You Is Wrong, I Don't Wanna Be Right, I've been holding my breath through the strike, terrified for the fate of <i>Pushing Daisies</i>, this beautiful baby bird of a TV show I've been doing. With the strike ended, we are all breathing again and anxious to get back to work this summer. Before I resume shooting the show, I'll spend the spring in New York, shoot a movie in Minneapolis, squeeze in some family time with my far-flung loved ones in Texas, Denver, and Oklahoma, do a concert with the Chicago Symphony, and give a special benefit performance for a friend in Manhattan -- all of which keeps me pleasantly occupied and comfortably distanced from L.A. with all its potential complications and painful reminders.</p><p>I make my way backstage in my Jimmy Choos. I'm getting nervous. This doesn't happen to me much anymore. Like everyone around me, I'm a seasoned pro. Stage fright is a thing of the past.

But young Father Flynn is most concerned with the fate of St. Ann&#x2019;s Well, which is set at the edge of the woods and slated for destruction. People have been coming to St. Ann&#x2019;s for generations to share their dreams and fears, and speak their prayers.

But then, as far as he knew he was the only priest in the world who had a thriving St. Ann&#x2019;s well in his parish, a holy shrine of dubious origin. A place where parishioners gathered to ask the mother of the Virgin Mary to intercede for them in a variety of issues, mainly matters intimate and personal. Areas where a clodhopping priest wouldn&#x2019;t be able to tread. Like finding them a fianc�, or a husband, and then blessing that union with a child.<br><br>Rome was, as usual, unhelpfully silent about the well.<br><br>Rome was probably hedging its bets, Father Flynn thought grimly, over there they must be pleased that there was <i>any</i> pious practice left in an increasingly secular Ireland and not wishing to discourage it. Yet had not Rome been swift to say that pagan rituals and superstitions had no place in the Body of Faith? It was a puzzlement, as Jimmy, that nice young doctor from Doon village, a few miles out, used to say. He said it was exactly the same in medicine: you never got a ruling when you wanted one, only when you didn&#x2019;t need one at all.<br><br>There used to be a ceremony on July 26 every year, where people came from far and near to pray and to dress the well with garlands and flowers. Father Flynn was invariably asked to say a few words, and every year he agonized over it. He could not say to these people that it was very near to idolatry to have hundreds of people battling their way toward a chipped statue in the back of a cave beside an old well in the middle of the Whitethorn Woods.<br><br>From what he had read and studied, St. Ann and her husband, St. Joachim, were shadowy figures, quite possibly confused in stories with Hannah in the Old Testament, who was thought to be forever childless but eventually bore Samuel. Whatever else St. Ann may have done in her lifetime two thousand years ago, she certainly had <i>not</i> visited Rossmore in Ireland, found a place in the woods and established a holy well that had never run dry.<br><br>That much was fairly definite.<br><br>But try telling it to some of the people in Rossmore and you were in trouble. So he stood there every year, mumbling a decade of the rosary, which couldn&#x2019;t offend anyone, and preaching a little homily about goodwill and tolerance and kindness to neighbors, which fell on mainly deaf ears.<br><br>Father Flynn often felt he had quite enough worries of his own without having to add St. Ann and her credibility to the list. His mother&#x2019;s health had been an increasing worry to them all, and the day was rapidly approaching when she could no longer live alone. His sister, Judy, had written to say that although Brian might have chosen the single, celibate life, she certainly had not. Everyone at work was either married or gay. Dating services had proved to be full of psychopaths, evening classes were where you met depressive losers; she was going to come to the well near Rossmore and ask St. Ann to get on her case.<br><br>His brother, Eddie, had left his wife, Kitty, and their four children to find himself. Brian had gone to look for Eddie&#x2014;who now found himself nicely installed with Naomi, a girl twenty years younger than the abandoned wife&#x2014;and had got little thanks for his concern.<br><br>&#x201c;Just because you&#x2019;re not any kind of a normal man at all, it doesn&#x2019;t mean that the rest of us have to take a vow of celibacy,&#x201d; Eddie had said, laughing into his face.<br><br>Brian Flynn felt a great weariness. He thought that he <i>was</i> in fact a normal man. Of course he had desired women, but he had made a bargain. The rules, at the moment, said if he were to be a priest then there must be no marriage, no children, no good, normal family life.<br><br>Father Flynn always told himself that this was a rule that would one day change. Not even the Vatican could stand by and watch so many people leave the ministry over a rule that was made by man and not by God. When Jesus was alive all the Apostles were married men, the goalposts were moved much later.<br><br>And then all the scandals in the Church were surely making the slow-moving conservative cardinals realize that in the twenty-first century some adaptations must be made.<br><br>People did not automatically respect the Church and churchmen anymore.<br><br>Far from it.<br><br>There were hardly any vocations to the priesthood nowadays. Brian Flynn and James O&#x2019;Connor had been the only two ordinations in the diocese eight years back. And James O&#x2019;Connor had left the Church because he had been outraged by the way an older, abusive priest had been protected and allowed to escape either treatment or punishment by a cover-up.<br><br>Brian Flynn was hanging in there, but only just.<br><br>His mother had forgotten who he was, his brother despised him and now his sister was making a trip from London to visit this cracked pagan well and wondering, would it work better if she came on the saint&#x2019;s Feast Day?<br><br>Father Flynn&#x2019;s parish priest was a gentle, elderly man, Canon Cassidy, who always praised the young curate for his hard work.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stay on here as long as I can, Brian, then you&#x2019;ll be considered old enough and they&#x2019;ll give you the parish,&#x201d; Canon Cassidy often said. He meant very well and was anxious to spare Father Flynn from the indignity of having some arrogant and difficult parish priest brought in over the curate&#x2019;s head. But at times Brian Flynn wondered if it would be better to let nature take its course, to hasten Canon Cassidy to a home for the elderly religious, to get someone, almost anyone, to help with the parish duties.<br><br>Admittedly, attendance at church had died off a great deal since he was a young man. But people still had to be baptized, given first Communion, have their confessions heard; they needed to be married and buried.<br><br>And sometimes, like in the summer, when a Polish priest came along to help him, Brian Flynn used to think he might manage better alone. The Polish priest last year spent <i>weeks</i> making garlands for St. Ann and her well.<br><br>Not long ago he had been at the junior school at St. Ita&#x2019;s and asked if any of the pupils wanted to become nuns when they grew up. Not an unreasonable question to ask little girls in a Catholic school. They were mystified. No one seemed to know what he meant.<br><br>Then one of them got it. &#x201c;You mean like the movie <i>Sister Act</i>?&#x201d;<br><br>Father Flynn felt that the world was definitely tilting.<br><br>Sometimes, when he woke in the morning, the day stretched ahead of him, confused and bewildering. Still he had to get on with things, so he would have his shower and try to pat down his red hair, which always stood in spikes around his head. Then he would make a cup of milky tea and a slice of toast and honey for Canon Cassidy.<br><br>The old man always thanked him so gratefully that Father Flynn felt well rewarded. He would open the curtains, plump up the pillows and make some cheerful comment about how the world looked outside. Then he would go to the church and say a daily Mass for an ever-decreasing number of the faithful. He would go to his mother&#x2019;s house, heart in his mouth about how he would find her.<br><br>Invariably she would be sitting at her kitchen table looking lost and without purpose. He would explain, as he always did, that he was her son, a priest in the parish; and he would make her a breakfast of porridge and a boiled egg. Then he would walk down Castle Street with a heavy heart to Skunk Slattery&#x2019;s newsagents where he would buy two newspapers: one for the canon and one for himself. This usually involved some kind of intellectual argument with Skunk about free will or predestination or how a loving God could allow a tsunami, or a famine. By the time he got back to the priests&#x2019; house, Josef, the Latvian caregiver, had arrived and got Canon Cassidy up, washed and dressed him and made his bed. The canon would be sitting waiting for his newspaper. Later, Josef would take the old man for a gentle walk to St. Augustine&#x2019;s Church, where he would say his prayers with closed eyes.<br><br>Canon Cassidy liked soup for his lunch and sometimes Josef took him to a caf� but mainly he took the frail little figure back to his own house, where his wife, Anna, would produce a bowl of something homemade; and in return the canon would teach her more words and phrases in English.<br><br>He was endlessly interested in Josef and Anna&#x2019;s homeland, asking to see pictures of Riga and saying it was a beautiful city. Josef had three other jobs: he cleaned Skunk Slattery&#x2019;s shop, he took the towels from Fabian&#x2019;s hairdressers to the Fresh as a Daisy Launderette and washed them there and three times a week he took a bus out to the Nolans&#x2019; place and helped Neddy Nolan look after his father.<br><br>Anna had many jobs too: she cleaned the brass on the doors of the bank, and on some of the office buildings that had big important-looking notices outside; she worked in the hotel kitchens at breakfast time doing the washing up; she opened the flowers that came from the market to the florists and put them in big buckets of water. Josef and Anna were astounded by the wealth and opportunities they&#x2019;d found in Ireland. A couple could save a fortune here.<br><br>They had a five-year plan, they told Canon Cassidy. They were saving to buy a little shop outside Riga.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;ll come to see us there?&#x201d; Josef said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll look down on you and bless your work,&#x201d; the canon said in a matter-of-fact tone, anticipating the best in the next world.<br><br>Sometimes Father Flynn envied him.<br><br>The old man still lived in a world of certainties, a place where a priest was important and respected, a world where there was an answer for every question asked. In Canon Cassidy&#x2019;s time there had been a hundred jobs a day for a priest to do. And not enough hours to do them.

Think again. The United States Patent Office has granted at least 40,000 patents on genes controlling the most basic processes of human life, and more are pending. If you undergo surgery in many hospitals you must sign away ownership rights to your excised tissues, even if they turn out to have medical and fiscal value. Life itself is rapidly becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the medical- industrial complex. <br><br><i>Deadly Monopolies</i> is a powerful, disturbing, and deeply researched book that illuminates this &#x201c;life patent&#x201d; gold rush and its harmful, and even lethal, consequences for public health. It examines the shaky legal, ethical, and social bases for Big Pharma&#x2019;s argument that such patents are necessary to protect their investments in new drugs and treatments, arguing that they instead stifle the research, competition, and innovation that can drive down costs and save lives. In opposing the commodification of the body, Harriet Washington provides a crucial human dimension to an often all-too-abstract debate. <br><br>Like the bestseller <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i>, <i>Deadly Monopolies</i> reveals in shocking detail just how far the profit motive has encroached in colonizing human life and compromising medical ethics. It is sure to stir debate&#x2014;and instigate change.</p><p><p><b>Harriet A.

There was a sense of betrayal. I mean, they owned a part of me that I could never recover. I certainly have no objection to scientific research . . . but it was like a rape. In a sense, you've been violated, for dollars. My genetic essence is held captive.<br><br>-John Moore, the subject of u.s. patent no. 4,438,032<br><br>In 1982, the mother of Japanese biotechnology scientist Dr. Heideaki Hagiwara was suffering from cervical cancer.1 When he learned that Dr. Ivor Royston at the University of California at San Diego was developing cell lines to treat cancer, he asked to join the laboratory and, once there, convinced Royston to use tumor cells from Hagiwara's mother's lymphatic system to create a therapeutic cell line.<br><br>A cell line is a community of cells, usually animal or human, that grows continuously in the laboratory, proliferating indefinitely under glass in precise, artificially maintained conditions, where it is used in research. In a warm living body, with its genius for homeostasis, every cell receives ample oxygen and nutrients in a dynamic environment tailored to its needs. But cells exiled to the cold, sterile prisons of unresponsive glassware tend to die quickly without the most assiduous coddling, although cancer cells live somewhat longer. Cell culture is the meticulous process by which optimal temperature, gas concentrations, and nutrients, which vary with the type of cell being cultured, are maintained, often with great difficulty.<br><br>Carefully tended cell cultures boost medical research by providing living human material for risk-free testing of the effectiveness and safety of drugs. But cell cultures can also host viruses and other pathogens, permitting them to be prepared in quantity for the manufacture of vaccines. Polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox viruses are currently produced in cell cultures. In the early twentieth century, Ross Granville Harrison of Johns Hopkins University established the technique of maintaining cells in vitro and dubbed it tissue culture.2 Because cancer cell lines are somewhat more long-lived than those of "normal" human cells, many extant cell lines are derived from cancers. By the mid-1900s, cell cultures were commonly used in laboratories.3<br><br>Some cell lines retain the characteristics of and produce substances that are peculiar to their cells of origin. Royston was working on a cell line that he hoped would treat cancers by producing antibodies that attack cancer cells. Hagiwara suggested that he use lymph cells from his sick mother, and Royston did so, fusing Hagiwara's mother's cells to the line. UCSD researchers soon agreed that this particular cell line possessed unique cancer-fighting properties, so Royston patented the promising cells. Hagiwara then returned to Japan, surreptitiously taking with him a sample of the cell line, which he used to treat his mother, who rallied but ultimately succumbed to her cancer.<br><br>Months later, Hagiwara gave the cell line to his father, Dr. Yoshide Hagiwara, who was also a biomedical researcher, for use in the family firm, the Hagiwara Institute of Health in Osaka. He claimed patent rights to the cell line and the antibodies it produced because it emanated from his mother's body, entitling his family, he said, to a financial interest in the cell lines. The U.S. Office of Technology Assessment disagreed and sued Hagiwara fils for taking the patented cells without permission.4 Hagiwara argued that despite the UCSD patent, the fact that the cell line had originated with his mother's tissues gave his family rights to the cells as well.<br><br>Hagiwara won these rights in a 1983 settlement with the university that gave the Hagiwaras the sole license to the patent throughout Asia.5 Patented entities can be licensed in an exclusive or a nonexclusive manner, and they can be licensed for specific geographic regions, and even for specific uses.6 In this case, the Hagiwaras' agreement with UCSD permitted them to use the line in research, but not to license it commercially elsewhere.<br><br>Twenty years later, another family affair was handled quite differently when FBI agents tracked down, arrested, and jailed Dr. Jiangyu Zhu, thirty, of China and Dr. Kayoko Kimbara, thirty-two, of Japan on June 19, 2002, in La Jolla, California.<br><br>The married couple were former fellows of Harvard Medical School who had resigned to pursue new research positions. But their time at Harvard had been very fruitful: from November 1998 through September 1999, Kimbara identified two genes that block the action of calcineurin, an enzyme that signals the immune system to reject transplanted organs. This was a potentially lucrative discovery that could transform organ transplantation by leading to immunosuppressive drugs, medicines that drastically lower the risks of organ rejection. It also was a potential treatment for several diseases that affect the cardiovascular, immune, and nervous systems, which multiplied its commercial potential. Then, on October 22, 1999, Harvard filed a provisional patent on the two genes and their products.<br><br>On December 13, 1999, Zhu and Kimbara accepted university research positions at the Institute of Biotechnology at the University of Texas, San Antonio, and when they left Harvard, they took some materials and notes with them, as researchers are wont to do. They were to begin on January 15, and by early January 2000 they shipped some additional materials from Harvard to their new lab.<br><br>But the university's complaint says that in direct violation of the participation agreement signed by both Zhu and Kimbara, Zhu emailed Medical and Biological Laboratories of Nagoya, a biochemical company in Japan,7 indicating that he intended to collaborate with a researcher there to commercialize the antibodies suggested by his Harvard gene research after he left Boston. Harvard says that Zhu also sent three other genes to Japan without its knowledge.<br><br>Harvard officials angrily accused Zhu and Kimbara of violating the terms of their agreement by sneaking into the lab in the wee hours to remove contested material, and of lying about having done so. The duo denied this, and the facts were never established in court. But according to the university's complaint, the Japanese company did succeed in producing antibodies against two of the three genes and then shipped them to Zhu at the University of Texas, where he now ran his own lab.<br><br>Removing materials is not a crime and is certainly not prosecuted unless the materials are alleged to be the property of the university, not the researcher. Even removing university property is acceptable if the amounts are not excessive and the researcher has appropriate permission. If the accusations of having lied about the removal of large quantities of university property are true, the couple become less sympathetic.<br><br>But it is important to evaluate such actions in the context of research culture: researchers typically remove materials from their laboratories when they leave for other institutions and sometimes do not ask permission to do so. There is no question that Heideaki Hagiwara, for example, had violated the spirit and the letter of the agreements he signed, yet he and UCSD were able to come to an amicable arrangement that recognized his contribution and shared the rights in the contested cell line. Therefore, many in the research community felt that Harvard overreacted when the university decided to play hardball.<br><br>Moreover, given that they were sued by Harvard, an academic behemoth of sterling reputation, it is also easy to overlook that Zhu and Kimbara steadfastly denied having taken disputed materials with them and that Harvard's very public accusations of theft were never publicly backed up with copies of agreements or evidence of wrongdoing.<br><br>The school brought criminal charges, and the two were charged with conspiracy, theft, theft of trade secrets, and (since they had left Texas and were now ensconced in new labs in San Diego) interstate transportation of stolen property.8 The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New England.<br><br>The Department of Justice press release, titled "Pair Charged with Theft of Trade Secrets from Harvard Medical School," focused on the fear of corporate competition, speculating that the two shared an "intention of profiting from such information by collaborating with a Japanese company in the creation and sale of related and derivative products."<br><br>Because any attempt to develop drugs from the pair's Harvard discovery threatened Harvard's own ability to patent calcineurin and sell the rights to a biotechnology company or corporation, this was a turf battle between Harvard and Medical and Biological Laboratories as well as between it and its erstwhile fellows. Unlike UCSD, Harvard did not seem inclined to share patent rights with the Japanese firm. The school and the FBI's public statements, however, focused on Zhu and Kimbara.<br><br>"Prosecuting people who steal the intellectual property of individuals and institutions is a very high priority for the Department of Justice," declared U.S. attorney Michael J. Sullivan. "Congress has enacted a series of laws to assure that innovators get credit for their inventions and if people steal the ideas that belong to someone else and try to use those ideas for their own economic benefit, they will be prosecuted. Protecting cutting-edge ideas is crucial to the creation of new products and our economy as a whole."<br><br>Discovering the genes was Kimbara's achievement, but the patent "ownership" was governed by her signed agreement with the school, which was never made public. As a research fellow at Harvard Medical School myself, I was required to sign an agreement ceding patent rights for any discovery to the "President and Fellows of Harvard College," but this was years after the Zhu-Kimbara incident and may not reflect agreements they made. I can't help reflecting that the oft-voiced virtue of the patent as a means of protect...</p><h2>The Dog Anatomy Workbook: A Learning Aid for Students</h2><p>Andrew Gardiner and Maggie Raynor have joined forces to produce this valuable learning aid for students on canine college and veterinary courses and those working in animal care and welfare.

Similarly, anyone who watches television must be aware of the Dreyfus Fund and its roaring symbol, the Wall Street lion. Few, however, realize any connection. Jack Dreyfus was once identified by <i>Financial World</i> magazine as one of the "greatest investors of the 20th century" and he founded one of the first major mutual funds. He also suffered from serious depression in 1957 and attributes his recovery to the drug phenytoin, known popularly as Dilantin. An unsuccessful 15-year campaign to win FDA approval and greater acceptance of this drug culminated in <i>A Remarkable Medicine</i>. Here Dreyfus tells his two stories. In the first he boasts matter-of-factly of his personal achievements and financial successes. In the second he dons again his battle armor to detail his frustrations with both the medical and the federal regulatory establishments and to extol the positive effects of Dilantin.

You'll run into one of these so-called purists on a trout stream and ask him what he's using. He'll say, "A Number thirty-two Royal Coachman on a three-ounce leader." Then he'll get a bite, snap his line out of the water, and there will be a worm on his hook. "That's the problem with these tiny flies," he'll say. "You keep catching worms with them." The truth is that live-bait fishing has a long and noble history. Live bait was totally unknown to the early cavemen, who had to make do with a rather limited assortment of dry flies, nymphs, and a few streamers. One day, whether out of exasperation or simple impatience, a caveman made a backcast with a gray hackle he had not bothered to remove from a sage hen. Instantly, it was taken by a brontosaurus. The caveman was elated by his discovery, even though it was several centuries before anyone learned how to take a brontosaurus off the hook. The caveman reasoned that if you can catch abrontosaurus with live bait. you can surely catch fish with it, and he immediately began conducting experiments. He tried live chickens, ducks, and geese, but he soon found these very undependable, particularly on casts that passed directly overhead. When he was about to give up and go back to dry flies, the caveman decided to bait his hook with a worm. He cast out into a deep, dark pool and immediately received the surprise of his life. A five-hundred-pound wild boar charged out of the brush and chased him for eighteen miles, and he never did learn whether worms were good bait. Thus the discovery of worms as fishing bait was left to a humble cook in the army of Genghis Khan. After a busy day of conquering the Civilized World, the Khan decided he would like fish for supper and dropped a casual hint to one of his lieutenants. The lieutenant, who had had considerable experience with the Khan's casual hints, nearly trampled three foot soldiers getting the news into the kitchen. Dismounting, he said to the cooks, "Guess what? Old G.K. wants fish for supper." Since fishing had been extremely poor and no one had had so much as a nibble in days, the kitchen staff immediately bought tickets and caught the first stage out of town, the single exception being a little hors d'oeuvre specialist, Leroy Swartz, who knew absolutely nothing about fishing. Leroy had never developed the knack for plundering and pillaging--though he wasn't bad at razing--and as a result his total loot for the campaign was a spade with a broken handle. For a reason known only to Leroy, he started digging up the ground with the spade. The lieutenant, assuming he was digging a grave, said, "If we can't get G.K. any fish for his supper, you might as well make that big enough for two." Then Leroy started picking up worms and stuffing them into his pocket,tomato cans not yet having been invented. He grabbed a fishing pole and went off to the nearest river, from whence he shortly returned with his limit, in those days as many as you could carry plus one fish. Everyone danced and shouted over Leroy's discovery that worms were excellent fishing bait. Even the Khan was beside himself with joy, a condition that caused Mrs. Khan considerable annoyance since they slept in the same bed. Leroy Swartz was henceforth known as the Father of Worms, a title he did not much care for, but it beat employment as a battering ram on the next fortress to be attacked. Toward the latter part of the eighteenth century, grasshoppers were discovered to be exceptional live bait. Up until then they were thought to be good only for devouring grain crops and causing widespread famine. One day an angler was walking along a country road in search of a good place to dig a supply of worms. He happened to glance out into a field fairly alive with grasshoppers and noticed a man leaping about on all fours and slapping the ground with his hat. The angler thought the fellow must be crazy to behave in such a strange manner and walked over to see what he was up to. It turned out the man <i>was</i> crazy, but the angler didn't discover this until he had helped him catch a dozen grasshoppers. Since by then it was too late to dig any worms, the angler decided to bait his hook with grasshoppers--and the rest is history. Up until the Industrial Revolution and the invention of tomato cans and the flat tobacco can, there were no suitable containers for live bait, and anglers had to carry their bait around in their hands, pockets, and hats. In the case of grasshoppers, wealthy fishermen would sometimes hire a boy to drive a herd of them along the bank. In later years worms were carried in pokes similar to those used for gold coins. There is at least one recordedinstance in which a card-playing fisherman narrowly escaped lynching when he attempted to bluff with a poke of nightcrawlers. So much for the history of live bait. We will now examine some of the various kinds of live bait, where to find it, how to preserve it, and assorted techniques for using it. First off, there are only two kinds of bait: live bait and dead bait. Worms, grubs, grasshoppers, minnows, and the like are live bait, unless left unattended in a hot car too long, in which case they become dead bait. I have on occasion forgotten to remove a can of worms from my car on a blistering July day, a mistake that has led to attempts to bait hooks with little balls of worm paste, not to mention the necessity of driving with all the car's windows open until approximately the middle of February. On the other hand, I've carried around salmon eggs and pickled pork rind until they were showing definite signs of life. My favorite method of preserving live bait is to store it in the refrigerator until it is ready for use. There are two schools of thought on the proper execution of this procedure. Some hold it is better to tell your wife first, and the others claim it is better to let her make the discovery for herself. I'm a member of the latter group and have been ever since my wife came across ajar of my hellgrammites while she was sorting through the refrigerator in search of some mayonnaise. The incident would probably have passed without any lingering ill effects had she not at the time been entertaining her church bridge club. It is difficult to describe the resulting commotion with any accuracy, but I learned later that cards from our bridge deck were found as far away as three blocks and one of the olive-and-avocado sandwiches served at the party turned up in a ladies' restroom halfway acrosstown. Our dog was asleep on the front sidewalk when the ladies left, and it was weeks before we could get all the dents out of him left by their heels. I have on occasion attempted to lay in a supply of worms during the spring months while they are still near the surface and one doesn't have to dig down to the aquifer to find them. I'll stash a couple of hundred of them in a washtub filled with dirt and feed them coffee grounds. The reason I feed them coffee grounds is that numerous people have told me that that is what worms like to eat. Whether they do or not, I'm not sure. In any case, I've yet to find a single worm when I dump out the tub later in the summer. I'm beginning to suspect that worms can't stand coffee grounds (or maybe coffee grounds like worms). When you stop to think about it, where would your average worm develop a taste for coffee anyway? The beginning angler is often of the impression that there are only three kinds of worms: small, medium, and large. Actually, the size of the worm makes little difference. Temperament and character are everything. These two characteristics seem to be determined primarily by environment. For example, I've never found a worm raised in a manure pile who could earn his keep as fishing bait. Manure-pile worms are soft and pale and accustomed to easy living. To a worm, a manure pile is a suite in the Ritz, a villa on the Riviera. He never has to worry about where his next meal is coming from. (If he knew, he would probably worry, but he doesn't know.) Manure-pile worms don't have any street savvy. Now, you dig up a worm out of a garden, an individual who has been through a couple of rototillings, and that worm has been around. He's going to go out and put up a good fight. Nothing builds character in a worm like a good rototilling. Some time ago a sporting-goods company sent me a package of freeze-dried worms. Honest. At first I thought it was some kind of veiled threat, but then I found a note saying that if I soaked the worms in water they would reconstitute into fishing bait. I stuck the package in my backpack with my other freeze-drieds and a couple of nights later at a mountain lake took it out and soaked the contents in some water. It turned out to be macaroni and cheese sauce. "That's funny," my friend Retch Sweeney said. "I thought we ate the macaroni and cheese sauce last night." The freeze-dried worms never did turn up. The most troublesome of all live bait is the grasshopper. By the time you've caught enough of them you're usually too tired to go fishing. Furthermore, grasshoppers are not content simply to sit around in a bottle waiting to be fed to some fish. Once a worm is in the can, he pretty well knows his fate is sealed and will lie back and take it easy until his number comes up. Not so with grasshoppers. They are no sooner in the bottle than they're plotting their escape. Every time the lid is lifted to insert a new inmate, half a dozen of the others will try to make a break for it. While I was still a young boy, I learned that the only way to foil their escapes was to shake the bottle vigorously and then slip the new grasshopper in while the others were still dazed. What apparently happens is that the grasshoppers get high from the shaking and like it so much that after a while you can hardly chase them out of the bottle with a stick. They just lie on their backs, smiling. Of course this is confusing to the new grasshopper, who thinks he has been incarcerated with a bunch of degenerate insects who keep calling out, "C'mon, man, give us another shake!" To my mind, the best live bait is the hellgrammite, aninsect that resides on streambeds and builds little cocoons for itself out of pebbles. Fish cannot resist them, in their shells or out. They are the salted peanuts of baits. Not long ago I was fishing a stream in Idaho and hadn't had a nibble all day. Then I discovered a nice patch of hellgrammites and within a half an hour had nearly filled my limit with plump cutthroat. There were a dozen or so other anglers on the stream, and they were so astonished at my success that they could not help expressing their awe by jovially threatening to slash my waders the next time I was in deep water. Finally, after I had creeled my final catch, a couple of them came over and demanded to know what I was using. "These," I said. "Jeez, those are ugly-looking things!" one of them said. "I almost hate to touch them." "Trout love 'em," I said. "Here, take a couple of mine just to try them out." I thought it was the very least I could do. As I was climbing into my car, I heard one of the other fishermen yell, "What was he using?" "These nasty-looking things," the first fellow yelled back. "Big, red, white, and blue flies!" I felt a little bad about the deception. On the other hand, you can never tell. There <i>could</i> be such a thing as patriotic fish.

But without Martha, there would be no George Washington. He called her &#34;my other self.&#34; Who was this woman who captured the heart of our country&#39;s founder? Martha DandridgeCurtis was a wealthy, attractive widow and the mother of two small children when she was courted by, then married to the French and Indian War hero. Her new life as Martha Washington took her through blissful times at Mount Vernon, family tragedies, six years of her husband&#39;s absence during the Revolutionary War, and her position as a reluctant First Lady.</p><p>Dear Reader:<br>&nbsp;<br>When I dove into the task of giving a voice to Martha's life, I didn't expect to be so . . . impressed. I admit to originally knowing only the basics: she was short, plump, had the odd name "Custis" attached, and was the wife of the first president of the United States. End of story.<br><br>Beginning of story. Or rather, a tiny part of the story. Because during the first half of her life there <i>was </i>no United States. The thirteen colonies were populated by loyal British subjects, and Martha's life was more about being a wife and mother than caring about politics. Like most of us today, Martha went about her business without thinking too much beyond the small scope of her world.<br><br>But then everything changed and she was thrust into a rebellion that--if not for the determination and courage of its participants, and the divine intercession of the Almighty--could have turned out far differently. Although I'd learned the fundamentals of this Revolutionary War period in school, I was embarrassingly ignorant in regard to the depth and breadth of the story. Now, although I am more knowledgeable, I feel unworthy. For what have I ever done to deserve the sacrifice of these patriots? I live the life they planted for me, enjoy the fruits of their initial labor, and breathe free through the gasps and groans of their courageous risk. What risk have I ever taken that comes close to theirs? What gives me the right to live as I do?<br><br>They gave me the right. <i>All </i>my rights as a free woman were ignited through their vision, struggle, and resolve. I've taken so much for granted . . . <br><br>I often think of the life Martha and George could have enjoyed if there had been no Glorious Cause. Eight years of war and eight years of the presidency could have been sixteen years of peaceful bliss shared at Mount Vernon, under their own "vine and fig tree." Yet without their sacrifice, I could not live now, in peaceful bliss, under <i>my </i>own vine and fig tree. <br><br>None of us could.<br><br>In the process of discovering this country's roots, I discovered my own. In the 1970's my mother put together a family history.&nbsp; She noted that one of my ancestors fought in the Revolutionary War: &nbsp;Jonathan Tyler. And so, on a trip to New England last year, through an amazing stream of non-coincidences, I found his grave and discovered that his family--my family--was one of the founding families of Piermont, New Hampshire. I left that tiny town girded by a profound sense of belonging, as if a foundation had been erected beneath me. My relatives have been in America since 1638, a fact that strengthens me--and makes me proud.<br>That's what I wish for you, dear reader. I hope Martha's story will nudge you toward finding your roots and your purpose, reignite your gratitude to God for all his gifts and blessings, and open your eyes to his work in the world beyond your own front door. <br><br>And then...I want you to go out and do something amazing and courageous.

French writer and feminist, and Existentialist. She is known primarily for her treatise The Second Sex (1949), a scholarly and passionate plea for the abolition of what she called the myth of the &#x201c;eternal feminine.&#x201d; It became a classic of feminist literature during the 1960s. Her novels expounded the major Existential themes, demonstrating her conception of the writer&#x2019;s commitment to the times. She Came To Stay (1943) treats the difficult problem of the relationship of a conscience to &#x201c;the other&#x201d;. Of her other works of fiction, perhaps the best known is The Mandarins (1954), a chronicle of the attempts of post-World War II intellectuals to leave their &#x201c;mandarin&#x201d; (educated elite) status and engage in political activism. She also wrote four books of philosophy, including The Ethics of Ambiguity (1947). Several volumes of her work are devoted to autobiography which constitute a telling portrait of French intellectual life from the 1930s to the 1970s. In addition to treating feminist issues, de Beauvoir was concerned with the issue of aging, which she addressed in A Very Easy Death (1964), on her mother&#x2019;s death in a hospital. In 1981 she wrote A Farewell to Sartre, a painful account of Sartre&#x2019;s last years. Simone de Beauvoir revealed herself as a woman of formidable courage and integrity, whose life supported her thesis: the basic options of an individual must be made on the premises of an equal vocation for man and woman founded on a common structure of their being, independent of their sexuality.

In the Soviet Union the celebrations were held on the following day. Newspaper photographs of VE-Day show dancing in the streets, fireworks, illuminations and scenes of jubilation. These moments of exhilaration remain fixed in the minds of all who took part in them, a high point of relief and rejoicing after the hardships, sorrows and privations of war.<br>VE-Day was the focal point of celebration and memory, but for many people, both soldiers and civilians, the war had ended earlier, for some much earlier. For the millions of military and civilian victims of combat, oppression and genocide, the war ended on the day of their death. Not a single day passed without the deaths of hundreds, in battle, in reprisal actions and in concentration camps. On average, more than twenty thousand people, soldiers and civilians, were killed each day of the Second World War; the same number that were killed on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916. For those who survived battle, aerial bombardment, execution and incarceration, the war ended with their liberation or repatriation from captivity. There were also more than a million Russians, including hundreds of thousands of former prisoners-of-war, who were repatriated, not to freedom, but to the Soviet gulag.<br>Liberation had come to northern France in June and July 1944, within weeks of the Normandy landings. The citizens of Paris had celebrated their freedom in August 1944, those of Warsaw in January 1945. In the same month the Soviet army reached Auschwitz, liberating the few thousand survivors still incarcerated there. Most of the prisoners at Auschwitz had, however, been moved to concentration camps within Germany before Auschwitz fell; those who had survived these &#x2018;death marches&#x2019; were freed in April 1945. Also liberated in April were many of the prisoner-of-war camps in which hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers, sailors and airmen had been held captive, some for more than five years.<br>The series of Allied victories, which began in North Africa in 1942 and in Russia in 1943, and which eventually brought the war to an end, had been won at an extraordinarily high cost in human life. Britain had been at war, and Poland had been under German occupation, for more than five and a half years. France, Belgium, Holland and Norway had suffered nearly five years of occupation. Greece, Yugoslavia and western Russia had been occupied for nearly four years. At sea, in the air, and from the air, the war had taken a daily and relentless toll.<br>For some of those who participated in the early battles, the war had ended swiftly. Fifty-five years later one British airman, Sergeant Roger Peacock, shot down during a bombing raid over Germany in July 1940, recalled the abrupt conclusion to his war, and the events that led up to it: &#x2018;On September 3rd, 1939 I was already engaged on flying duties as the third, and least, member of the crew of a light bomber of 2 Group Bomber Command. It was not long before it became quite clear to the realists among us &#x2013; most of us that is &#x2013; that we were not likely to survive. By the time the French campaign began, on May 10th, 1940 (a day known irreverently to us as Woompit Day, a reference to the noise made by the copious light flak with which the enemy supported his advancing troops) a man fresh from Operational Training Unit and posted to a fighting squadron might expect to live rather less than three weeks. Some men &#x2013; men at eighteen or so? &#x2013; lasted a mere day. In July 1940 No 40 Squadron had three commanding officers; the second flew in at teatime one day, to replace his predecessor lost only hours earlier. He showed willing by putting his name on the Dawn Battle Order, took off next day at 3.30 am and failed to return. He had not even unpacked, which meant that tidying up his affairs was relatively simple.&#x2019;<br>Each morning when Peacock awoke he inevitably wondered, like all his fellow-airmen, &#x2018;whether that day would be my last. I had prayed, of course, not for survival (which would have been cheating) but that I might be spared long enough to see the spring in my beloved England. My prayer was granted; it was in the closing days of July 1940 that Lachesis and Atropos caught up with me.1 In the course of an attack on the Luftwaffe airfield at Jever, a few miles west of Wilhelmshaven, our kite was disabled. There was a comical failure of communication: the two men in front baled out at some 8,000 feet or so, but I sat calmly in the back while the aircraft descended in sweeping spirals, waiting to be told when to go. By the time I found that I was alone and knelt beside my hatch, the kite was down to some four hundred feet and I wondered dispassionately, but briefly, whether it was worth while trying to use my parachute or whether an instant and painless death was preferable.&#x2019;<br>Peacock jumped. &#x2018;There was just time to pull the D-ring before I found myself spreadeagled on my back in a potato field. Some determined twitching of my various extremities convinced me that once I had got my breath back I would be well. My pilot landed only a few yards away and together we turned our backs on the blazing wreck of our poor Blenheim. In vain: within a few yards I was accosted by a nervous gentleman in an unfamiliar uniform, holding a quavering pistol within inches of my chest, and demanding, &#x201c;H�nde boch: Sie sind mein Gefangener&#x201d;.1 It was ironic that only recently &#x2013; perhaps the previous day &#x2013; I had committed to memory that very phrase, offered to its readers by the Daily Express as a guide to &#x201c;How to Receive a German Paratrooper who lands in your Back Garden&#x201d; (an invasion was expected daily). The next thing he said, having assured himself that I was unarmed was, &#x201c;For you the war is over.&#x201d; Perhaps he had learned that from his paper?&#x2019;2<br>Roger Peacock remained a prisoner-of-war for nearly five years. Ten million soldiers like him were to reach the end of their fighting war in a prisoner-of-war cage or prison barrack. More than three million Russian soldiers captured by the Germans on the Eastern Front died of deliberate exposure and starvation, their lives ending amid great cruelty and ignominy.<br>From the first serious reversal of the tide of war in Russia in the summer of 1943, hundreds of towns and villages in the East were freed from the Nazi oppressor. In southern Italy, liberation from fascism came in the autumn of 1943. While the outcome of the war was still uncertain, gravely injured Allied prisoners-of-war were repatriated from Germany, though not from Japan or, as far as German prisoners-of-war were concerned, from the Soviet Union. Civilian internees from Western countries were also returned home.<br>One such civilian internee, the British-born Ursula Wright, who had been held in various camps in Vichy France, including Vittel, since the end of 1940, later recalled the day in October 1943 when her war ended: &#x2018;I was repatriated through an exchange of prisoners, along with a number of other internees. We travelled by train through Germany, with many stops in railway sidings, and finally arrived at the port of Rostock. Here we met Count Bernadotte who was negotiating our transfer through Sweden. We sailed to Trelleborg and went from there to G�teborg under the care of the Swedish Red Cross. I remember the lovely porridge, with thick cream, served on the train, so different from our camp fare.&#x2019;<br>At G�teborg, those being repatriated were put on board the British ocean liner Empress of Russia, &#x2018;painted white to show she was a hospital ship, and there we met many British soldiers, mostly wounded, and their protected personnel aides. We were given a marvellous send-off, with a band on the quay-side, and I believe the King and Queen of Sweden were there. I know Princess Louise, the Crown Princess as she was then, was at our departure, talking to some of the wounded soldiers. She was, of course, English (of the Mountbatten family). After an interesting journey through the Skagerrak we sailed across the North Sea to Scotland, where we were welcomed by a flotilla of little ships and then I, and some soldiers from that area, were transported to Hull. There I was given, which I felt I didn&#x2019;t deserve, a sort of hero&#x2019;s welcome, as the people there had suffered much more from the war than I had.&#x2019;1<br>During 1944 the pace of liberation grew. With it, in the East, came the imposition of Communist rule over large areas of inter-war Poland. In Yugoslavia, Tito&#x2019;s partisans were wresting much of the country from German control. In Italy, Allied forces entered Rome on 4 June 1944, having established an Italian anti-fascist administration in the south. From the first hours of the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, French villages, and then towns, and finally Paris itself, were freed. For millions of French citizens the war ended that summer and early autumn. Georges Bonnin, who had been arrested early in July for refusing to work in Germany, recalled vividly the day that the war ended for him. It was 20 August 1944. &#x2018;I was then in a Gestapo prison in Toulouse. The wardens, ordinary soldiers of the Wehrmacht, asked our small staff to stand in a line, shook hands with us and with a hearty: &#x201c;Auf Wiedersehen! Alles gute!&#x201d; (&#x201c;Goodbye, Godspeed&#x201d;) as if we were old friends, left in a small ambulance. They did not go very far, for they were caught in the Rh�ne Valley near Avignon. We were so lucky to escape with our lives. A few days earlier four of us had been taken away by the Gestapists and never returned. I learned later that, with two dozen from other prisons, they had been burned alive. It was a symbolic execution; the Wehrmacht general commanding in Toulouse had left giving the instruction to the Gestapo: &#x201c;Liquidate the prisons.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>Bonnin also recalled what he described as &#x2018;a little twist&#x2019; in the story. &#x2018;Among those wishing well to the departing wardens there was Frau P, who had been arrested by the French in 1939 as German, and re-arrested as Jewish in 1941 by the Germans when they occupied the South zone. She was a remarkable typist: During the interrogations of Jews, she was typing their confessions &#x2013; she had to &#x2013; translating directly into German if necessary. Incidentally they were beaten up and their screams could be heard through the open windows. When I arrived at the Nuremberg Trial, whom should I see? Frau P wearing a dark green United States uniform. &#x201c;Where did I see you?&#x201d; she asked, slightly alarmed. In the course of the conversation it appeared that she was in fact in touch with the wardens, still prisoners in Avignon. She was making sure that they would get their rations of cigarettes and chocolate. This is all part of the rich pattern of life.&#x2019;1<br>During the first three months of 1945 the German forces, which had stood triumphant within sight of Moscow, and on the Atlantic coast of France, were driven back by their adversaries deep into Germany. Still they resisted the onward march of the Allies. Seeking to stave off defeat, and to hide the consequences of the Nazi system, they moved hundreds of thousands of slave labourers and concentration camp prisoners deeper and deeper into Germany, trying to keep them away from the advancing soldiers, fearful of what might be the Allied reaction to so many starved, emaciated and desperately sick prisoners and slave labourers. As the Allied armies advanced, enormous numbers of German soldiers laid down their arms. On the Loire, an American officer, Lieutenant Colonel J.K. French, from Virginia, co-ordinated the surrender of 19,000 German troops.2<br>As the Russian forces moved westward during the early spring of 1945, the war ended for the much-bombed, and latterly much-shelled inhabitants of a hundred towns in the regions that were overrun. But the torments of peace could be harsh. In K�nigsberg, once the capital of East Prussia, there was little to celebrate on the day the war ended, or in the days that followed. The occupation forces did little to feed the inhabitants, many of whom died of starvation. In the words of two historians, &#x2018;Rape, looting and pillage defined life&#x2019;. A German woman in the city later recalled how, after she and her friends had been raped, &#x2018;we often asked the soldiers to shoot us, but they always answered: &#x201c;Russian soldiers do not shoot women, only German soldiers do that.&#x201d; &#x2019;3<br>Nearly six million Germans left their homes and fled westward in front of the advancing Russians. An estimated one million died as they fled, from exhaustion and starvation, from bomb and machine-gun attack from the air, or accidentally caught up in the battle that continued to scar the eastern extremity of the Third Reich. As the German civilians fled, they often came in sight of other columns of men and women: of British and French prisoners-of-war being marched westward to avoid liberation by the Red Army, and of emaciated, terrified Jews, the men and women being marched separately, who were being taken from the slave labour camps of the East to new camps in the West.<br>By the end of March 1945, Allied armies were on the borders of Germany in both the East and West. France and Belgium had been freed. Fighting was continuing in northern Italy, in Yugoslavia and in Hungary. Holland, Denmark and Norway remained under German occupation. The threat of Hitler&#x2019;s secret weapons had ended: the terrors of the rocket bombs and the prospect of a renewed German submarine offensive were over. Yet the tenacity of the German army on all fronts meant that there would be no sudden collapse, as in 1918. The struggle to end the Second World War would bring the ferocity of aerial and artillery bombardment to almost every corner of the Third Reich. The siege of Breslau, where for eighty-two days the city defenders refused to surrender, and tens of thousands of civilians were blown to pieces in their homes and shelters, indicated that the struggle would have to continue until Germany was completely crushed.<br>When the First World War had broken out in 1914 there were those in every land who were confident that it would end by that Christmas. When 1945 opened there was equal confidence that the war in Europe would end by the summer, if not sooner. Looming over the prospect of imminent victory, however, was the spectre of the continuing war against Japan, in which American, British, Australian and Dutch troops were bearing the brunt of an implacable enemy. As Germany faced defeat, Japan was still holding on to part of Burma, was occupying Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Indo-China and large areas of China, and was fighting a stubborn retreat across the Pacific Ocean island by island, determined to resist any landing on the Japanese mainland with all the considerable resources at its military and autocratic command.<br>1 Lachesis was one of the three Fates.

Try this!</p><p>Jim Arnosky lives in South Ryegate,Vermont.<i>Starred Review.</i> Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;This is the story of an older buffalo that is no longer able to keep up with the rest of the herd. While the idea that the once-powerful old bull is growing older and unable to keep pace is sad, he is filled with serenity. In his travels behind the herd, he comes across a buffalo cow about to give birth. He stays with her throughout her labor and protects and cares for the calf, saving it during a dust storm. The book portrays the circle of life in a beautiful way, but it also shows the protective bond between young and old, as well as the important role Grandfather Buffalo continues to play in the herd dynamic. This book is a perfect interplay of poetic text and strong art that is full of love and empathy. Arnosky gives the impression of the harshness of the prairie environment without overdramatizing. Each spread features the majestic expanse of the tall grass and the other creatures that inhabit it. This is Arnosky at his excellent best.<i>&#x2013;Susan E.

With illustrations by Jason Polan.</b><br><br>The seven years between the birth of Etgar Keret&#x2019;s son and the death of his father were good years, though still full of reasons to worry. Lev is born in the midst of a terrorist attack. Etgar&#x2019;s father gets cancer. The threat of constant war looms over their home and permeates daily life.<br><br>What emerges from this dark reality is a series of sublimely absurd ruminations on everything from Etgar&#x2019;s three-year-old son&#x2019;s impending military service to the terrorist mind-set behind Angry Birds. There&#x2019;s Lev&#x2019;s insistence that he is a cat, releasing him from any human responsibilities or rules. Etgar&#x2019;s siblings, all very different people who have chosen radically divergent paths in life, come together after his father&#x2019;s shivah to experience the grief and love that tie a family together forever. This wise, witty memoir&#x2014;Etgar&#x2019;s first nonfiction book published in America, and told in his inimitable style&#x2014;is full of wonder and life and love, poignant insights, and irrepressible humor.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of June 2015:</strong> Etgar Keret is not your usual memoirist. For his first foray into the genre&#x2014;he is the author of several lauded short story collections&#x2014;Keret chose the titular <em>Seven Good Years</em> between the birth of his son and the death of his father as temporal boundaries for a series of four- to five-page vignettes and ruminations, ranging from humorous to anxious (but humorous) to heavy (and humorous). And for the most part, those events don&#x2019;t even define the content of this collection. Keret&#x2014;a native of Israel&#x2014;contemplates moments of his life against a backdrop of constant conflict, casting an absurd light on both the monumental and mundane: a time-wasting game of chicken with a telemarketer becomes an irritating <em>memento mori</em>; the terrorist subtext of Angry Birds comes disturbingly (if somewhat speciously) clear; a whimsical mustache conjures a story of a near-fatal encounter in Lebanon. His compact style benefits the brevity of the pieces, perfectly matching his skewed and occasionally detached tone; Keret is a sort of bemused and sometimes baffled observer of the world and the people who inhabit it, and simply a wonderful writer. --<em>Jon Foro</em></p><b>Etgar&nbsp;Keret</b>&nbsp;was born in Ramat Gan and now lives in Tel Aviv.

ON A horse with a noose around my neck, my hands tied behind my back, and the steed about to be whipped out from under me, I could already feel el diablo&#x2019;s hot claws gripping my ankles tightly, ready to pull me down after the rope strangled me.<br>I held my legs tight against each side of the stallion&#x2019;s flank, a signal that he would recognize as a command not to bolt. He and I had been through a lot together. We knew each other well&#x2014;or so I hoped.<br>The coarse rope&#x2014;tied to a thick branch overhead that had been chosen to bear my weight without breaking&#x2014;was biting into my neck, the slipknot choking me, threatening to crush my windpipe and cut off my breathing each time the nervous horse moved.<br>My wrists were raw from trying to pull and twist my hands out of the bindings. I didn&#x2019;t care if blood ran freely from them so long as it helped get my hands loose, but the hacienda owners&#x2014;the hacendados&#x2014;who had captured me had had their vaqueros tie the cords too tight.<br>As a man of many professions that brought me into close contact with the king&#x2019;s constables&#x2014;horse thief, bandido, and impersonator of a wealthy caballero, to name a few of my trades&#x2014;I knew only too well what would happen when my captors swatted the horse&#x2019;s rump with a quirt and caused the spirited stallion to bolt out from under me.<br>I would be left hanging&#x2014;literally&#x2014;but it would not kill me. Not quickly, at least. Dying would take an excruciating amount of time because of the short fall off of the horse. That is what hanging is all about, amigos&#x2014;the length of the fall before the loop tightens around a person&#x2019;s neck.<br>Being lynched in the forest by vigilantes meant I would be pulled off the horse as he surged forward and drop only a couple of feet. That would leave me dangling at the end of the rope to slowly suffocate.<br>Unfortunately, since I am young and strong, it will take perhaps half an hour or more for that coarse rope around my neck to squeeze the life out of me, as I twisted, kicked, and jerked, my face bloated and red, blood foaming out of my mouth, my eyes bulging from their sockets.<br>Ayyo! Perhaps I should have been a priest instead of a bad man, but that was not the path that the Fates&#x2014;those three remorseless old crones who decide our destinies&#x2014;had set me upon. Had they a bit of mercy in their immortal souls they would have seen to it that I fell into the clutches of constables rather than arrogant Spanish horse owners who were only too ready to throw a rope over a branch rather than take the time and effort of getting the authorities involved.<br>The Spanish viceroy had had gallows erected in the Z�calo, the main square in Mexico City, as a reminder to the indios that he was in control of the colony. The gallows were built high so that when the trapdoor opened beneath the prisoner&#x2019;s feet, he fell far enough for the fall to snap his neck&#x2014;if the noose was tied and the knot placed correctly, of course. And if the prisoner&#x2019;s family crossed the hangman&#x2019;s palm with a coin or two, a sack of sand was tied to the prisoner&#x2019;s feet to increase the chances of his neck breaking.<br>The hanged man was still strangled by the rope, but a broken neck caused a much quicker loss of consciousness and death.<br>Such were the dark thoughts that were going through my head as the Spaniards discussed my fate&#x2014;not whether I would be hanged, of course, but how quickly it would occur. One of them actually wanted to get a priest to give me last rites&#x2014;bless that man&#x2019;s pious soul!&#x2014;but I could tell that his argument about it being the Christian thing to do was not setting well with the others who wanted a taste of blood&#x2014;<i>my blood</i>.<br>The man who favored a priest even wanted to know my name, and I made up one because my true name, Juan the L�pero, would have hurried the hanging even more because l�peros were street trash considered worse than lice and accursed by God.<br>The proof to me that those hags called the Fates had gotten an iron grip on my cojones and squeezed tight had to do with the strange twist about the mare&#x2014;I was being hanged for stealing, but I had actually not stolen her. The Spaniards refused to believe that the mare was simply following me because she enjoyed the tune I was humming.<br>I didn&#x2019;t blame the hacendados&#x2014;I wouldn&#x2019;t have believed the story myself if I were them&#x2014;but it happened to be the truth, in a manner of speaking. I <i>was</i> humming a tune and the mare <i>did</i> follow me.<br>There were other times when I hummed that same tune and horses followed me. S�, I do not deny it&#x2014;I am a horse thief and I am able to make a sound that soothes horses and attracts them to me. Except this time I hadn&#x2019;t intended to steal the horse, at least that was not what I had set out to do. Acting from habit, I was just practicing the method I had used many times in the past with horses.<br>So I suppose one could say that in the eyes of Se�ora Justice, I was not being hanged for stealing this mare, but for the many other horses I had stolen in the past&#x2014;but she is blind, no?<br>Truthfully, I don&#x2019;t wish to be hanged, period. However, I will admit that if anyone deserved to swing on the rope for horse stealing, it would be me.<br>But now was not the time, because forty-eight years after the defeat of the Aztecs and conquest by the Spanish of the One-World, I was on a mission to unravel a puzzle and solve a mystery about the finest horses of the colony.<br>Horses are, of course, <i>everything</i> in the colony. That is why I was being hanged so quickly.<br>Had I stolen the wife or daughter of a hacendado, my sentencing to death would have taken much longer. But to steal a horse&#x2014;that was a mortal sin above the murder of a human being.<br>Many thoughts go through a man&#x2019;s mind when he is about to be hanged as a horse thief. Could I have run faster to escape? Chosen a different horse to steal? Shouted my innocence louder?<br>Did you expect me to be remorseful about my choice of occupation? Perhaps wish that I had been a priest smelling of wine and righteousness instead? Or a merchant with my heart pumping and my hands sweaty, counting my coins?<br>If you thought those trades were open to one who carries the blood taint of mixed indio and Spanish blood, you have been eating some of those mushrooms that indio healers use to open their minds so they might speak to the gods.<br>No, I was a horse thief&#x2014;born to hang.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2012 by Eugene Winick, Executor, Estate of Gary Jennings<br></p><h2>God&#39;s Inspirational Promise Book</h2><p>This is a small leatherbound book full of inspirational messages from Max Lucado covering such topics as christian living, guidance, personal relationships, etc...</p><p></p><h2>More Parts</h2><p>People say the strangest things: Give me a hand . . .

But be careful, readers: This clever book just might make you laugh your heads off!</p><p><b>Tedd Arnold</b>&nbsp; is the author of such children's classics as&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>No Jumping on the Bed!</i> and <i>No More Water in the Tub!</i> He has published more than 50 books as author and illustrator. He has received&nbsp; The Theodor Seuss Geisel Honor&nbsp;for <i>I Spy Fly Guy </i>and has won&nbsp;The&nbsp;Edgar Award for his Young Adult Novel, <i>Rat Life.</i>Gr 1-4-Through zany, brightly colored illustrations and rhyming verse, Arnold explores common figures of speech that amaze and frighten a young boy. "I'll bet that broke your heart," "give him a hand," "Hold your tongue," and "jumps out of his skin" are only a few of the sayings that worry the protagonist, whose imaginings are energetically depicted in colored-pencil and watercolor washes. Goofy, cartoonlike artwork explores the deepest recesses of the child's overwrought and overworked imagination. Kids will love faces cracking, lungs being coughed up, and bodies flying apart. Vivid color and a robust artistic style will attract younger children who may not get the joke, but older children and parents will. Singsong verses in hand-lettered text strain to rhyme in some instances, with a forced, uneven gait. Although the boy's parents reassure him, the story ends where it begins. The father, who "didn't mean to be unkind," tells the child that they were afraid that he'd lost his mind. The final drawing has the boy's brain falling out of his head and onto the floor. This story is like a wild and crazy, totally manic Amelia Bedelia. Children will ask for it again and again.<p></p><p><i>Alice Casey Smith, Sayreville Public Schools, Parlin, NJ</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Malice (The Faithful and the Fallen)</h2><p>1st UK ed #408/500.

The rain is so heavy, so constant, that we don&#x2019;t even hear it anymore, and the house phone has been dead for hours. My parents are grounded at Uncle Charlie&#x2019;s house in New Orleans with no way to get home until after the storm has blown over. Carly&#x2019;s mom is trapped downtown at the hospital where she works. It&#x2019;s painful, listening to Carly talk to her. They&#x2019;re both yelling to hear over the storm, and the electricity is out, and I&#x2019;m pretty sure the cell is almost out of juice.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be fine, Mama,&#x201d; Carly says, her voice firm and certain.<br> <br>&#x201c;But, baby. The storm.&#x201d; Her mom&#x2019;s voice through the speakerphone is the opposite, flighty and anxious and unsure. &#x201c;When I think of you and Dovey alone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Miz Ray&#x2014;&#x201d; I start, but Carly holds up one furious finger to shush me.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re sixteen, Mama. We&#x2019;ve lived in Savannah all our lives. We know how to handle a storm. Besides, they said it&#x2019;s coming too fast, and trees are all over the road. You&#x2019;re safer where you are.&#x201d; Carly looks at me, rolling her eyes and shaking her head at how ridiculous parents can be. Thunder booms, rocking the small house, and I gasp. She shakes her head harder, warning me not to scare her mama.<br> <br>&#x201c;I should have come home hours ago, but Mr. Lee&#x2019;s respirator died, and we have to keep pumping him, and everybody else was gone, and I just couldn&#x2019;t leave him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, sugar. I&#x2019;m so sorry. Y&#x2019;all get in the downstairs bathroom&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The sound cuts off, and Carly stares at the dead phone like she wants to crush it in her fist. Thunder shakes the house again, and a flash of lightning illuminates the shabby living room. Suddenly everything seems very still. The wind goes silent. Our eyes meet in the dim light. We both know, deep down in our bones, that the storm is at its most deadly right when things get quiet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; she says, grabbing the flashlight and pulling my hand. Despite how steady she sounded with her mom on the phone, her palm is clammy with fear. I can see the whites of her eyes, all around, too bright against her dark skin.<br> <br>Carly drags me down the hall to the bathroom, and we step into the bathtub. We&#x2019;re both barefoot, and the puddled water from the drippy faucet is slick and cold. No matter what Carly told her mom, neither of us really knows what else to do, so we just stand there dumbly in our too-short shorts, listening hard in the darkness. Up until just now the air was heavy, too hot and thick for November. They were calling it an Indian summer, a freak occurrence.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;re calling Josephine, too.<br> <br>I look at my best friend, and I&#x2019;m afraid to speak; it&#x2019;s as if the storm would be able to hear me, would be able to find us hiding here. Carly&#x2019;s arms wrap around me, and the corduroy on her favorite orange jacket scratches my bare shoulders. We both started out in tank tops, but as soon as the clouds got dark, she went for her jacket.<br> <br>&#x201c;Storm keeps up like this, maybe you&#x2019;ll finally get to see an albino alligator,&#x201d; she says, voice shaking. &#x201c;Gigi says floods bring &#x2019;em up from the sewer.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shudder at the mention of my own personal boogeyman. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try to spook me, girl. Storm keeps up like this, I&#x2019;m moving to California. Earthquakes are quicker. And dryer.&#x201d;<br> <br>A quick smile. &#x201c;If we get through this, I&#x2019;ll go with you.&#x201d; She trembles against me, tosses her head. The pink beads at the end of her braids clatter against the shower tiles.<br> <br>A rumble builds outside, louder and louder. The sound is strange and unnatural and rushing, and then the wall shudders and I hear the splash of water lapping at the house. The Savannah River must have flooded, just like they said it might.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a long creaking outside, followed by a loud crack. The window glass explodes, half of an oak tree slamming through the tiny bathroom. We both crouch and scream as glass, branches, leaves, and broken tiles rain down. Carly grabs my hand and drags me out of the tub, the glass and splinters barely registering as we leave bloody footprints on our way into the hall.<br> <br>Something crashes in the kitchen, and I realize we&#x2019;re trapped. Every direction screams danger. The front door slams open, water gushing over the scuffed wood floors. Carly starts panting and shaking her head, her eyes squeezed shut. She can&#x2019;t swim, and she hates dark water. I look up and grab the ragged string to her attic, pull down the stairs. There&#x2019;s an angry creak and a burst of hot trapped air.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not supposed to go upstairs in a storm,&#x201d; she whispers.<br> <br>Before I can answer, dirty water sloshes into the hall from the kitchen, rushing cold over our feet. When I start up the rickety steps, she pauses for just a moment before following me, the old wood of the stairs complaining under our weight.<br> <br>Carly&#x2019;s attic is the same jumble of crap as everyone else&#x2019;s, and the first thing I do is bang my shin on something. The flashlight is gone&#x2014;I must have dropped it in the tub. There&#x2019;s a little bit of light coming from the place where the tree slammed through the house, a ragged hole showing the dead purple-green sky outside.<br> <br>I maneuver around the boxes and broken furniture to the corner of the attic opposite the fallen tree, and I can hear Carly crawling behind me. The attic is unfinished, and we pick our way carefully across rotting plywood and empty places filled with musty insulation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Y&#x2019;all should have finished this rat hole,&#x201d; I say, and Carly snorts.<br> <br>&#x201c;You got two good parents, and your attic&#x2019;s worse.&#x201d;<br> <br>I smile to myself, glad she can talk again. If she&#x2019;s sassing me, she&#x2019;s still okay.<br> <br>We find enough space to fit both of us and sit together, knees drawn up, hands clasped. The noises outside are loud and confusing and terrifying, all rushing water and cracks and crashing.<br> <br>She leans against me. &#x201c;Remember when we said we were running away, and we only got as far as Baker&#x2019;s house before it started raining?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Freaking downpour. He found us hiding under his trampoline with a backpack full of wet peanut butter crackers. Brought us an umbrella and tried to convince us to come inside and play Tomb Raider. You wouldn&#x2019;t do it, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>Carly chuckles. &#x201c;I was mad. Didn&#x2019;t want to eat my damn collards, no matter what my mama said.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You always were stubborn. But I like that about you.&#x201d;<br> <br>She slings an arm around my shoulders. &#x201c;You just got to learn to stand up for yourself, Dovey. You&#x2019;re stronger than you look. You&#x2019;ve just got to own it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get right on that, once this storm&#x2019;s over.&#x201d;<br> <br>I know she&#x2019;s talking to make me feel better, and it was working at first. But things have gotten louder and more frantic outside, and I can&#x2019;t feel my feet anymore.<br> <br>&#x201c;Josephine&#x2019;s one mad crazy bitch,&#x201d; Carly says. &#x201c;But I bet Katrina was meaner.&#x201d;<br> <br>The roof explodes over our heads, a thick branch slamming into Carly. I scramble up, but the tree is heavy and tearing down through the attic. As I back away, I try to pull Carly with me as the rain pounds down on our heads. Half the attic rips away, and the wind and rain lash us from every direction. I can barely tell which way is up. And Carly won&#x2019;t budge. Her hand slips from mine, and I push things out of the way, making a path for her to follow as I scramble toward the attic stairs.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on! We have to get out of here!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Daddy?&#x201d; Carly says, her voice all wrong. Instead of moving away from the tree, from the hole in the attic, from a furious sky vomiting rain and lightning, she moves toward it. I step closer and see blood trickling from a big gash on her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Carly! Let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d;<br> <br>But she doesn&#x2019;t hear me. The branch must have hit her pretty hard. I pick my way over the jagged timbers and weak spots of insulation, but she&#x2019;s almost to the edge of the hole. A board snaps under my foot, and I lurch sideways, almost fall through the ceiling. She sets a bare, bleeding foot onto the tree trunk.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t go outside, fool,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Come back in. It&#x2019;ll be over soon. We&#x2019;ll get you to the hospital.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Daddy&#x2019;s outside, Dovey,&#x201d; she says in a weird, childlike voice. &#x201c;Daddy, and your nana. Waiting.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a goddamn storm, girl. Snap out of it!&#x201d;<br> <br>I grab her hand and yank, but her skin is wet with sweat and blood and the rain that won&#x2019;t stop pounding down on us through the place where the roof used to be. She slips out of my grasp and sits on the ragged tree trunk like it&#x2019;s a slide. I grab for her again, but she pushes off, letting herself fall. I reach for her hand, but she&#x2019;s gone. The last thing I see of my best friend is her dark skin and bright pink fingernails swallowed up by the swollen river running down the street we grew up on. The water is up to the window below, churning grayish brown. I scream and search for Carly. Swirling along with the water, I see cars, bikes, children&#x2019;s toys, tree branches, bloated hairy things. But no Carly.<br> <br>I stand there so long that I can&#x2019;t feel my hands. I stand there, looking for my best friend&#x2014;first for her alive and swimming, and then dead and floating. At some point I drag myself deeper into the attic and hide under an old rug that smells like cat piss. I stay there, shivering and crying, until the storm is over and I hear Carly&#x2019;s mom calling her name.</p><h2>Wild Animals I Have Known</h2><p>An immediate success upon its first publication in 1898, <i>Wild Animals I Have Known</i> gave the animal story new credibility and power as a literary genre and remains Seton&#x2019;s best-loved work.</p><p>Ernest Thompson Seton was born in South Shields, Durham, England, in 1860. His family emigrated to Canada in 1866 and settled near Lindsay, Ontario. Four years later they moved to Toronto, where Seton received his early education. He graduated from the Ontario College of Art in 1879 and pursued further studies at the Royal Academy in England, and at l'Acad�mie Julian in Paris.<br><br>Seton returned to Canada in 1881 and joined his brother on a homestead near Carberry, Manitoba. There he made extensive notes on the behaviour of animals and birds, complementing his studies as a naturalist with commissioned work as an illustrator and painter.<br><br>His first collection of animal stories, <b>Wild Animals I Have Known</b> (1898), won immediate critical and popular acclaim, and was followed in the next four decades by more than thirty volumes of such fiction.<br>Seton founded a youth organization, the League of Woodcraft Indians, and in 1910 joined Lord Baden-Powell in establishing the Boy Scouts of America. In the same year, he wrote the <b>Boy Scouts of America Official Manual</b>.<br><br>In 1930 Seton moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he set up Seton Village, a centre for environmentalists, naturalists, and students of North American Indian culture.<br><br>Ernest Thompson Seton died in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1946.<b>Lobo</b><br><b>The King of Currumpaw</b><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>I<br>&nbsp;<br>Currumpaw is a vast cattle range in northern New Mexico. It is a land of rich pastures and teeming flocks and herds, a land of rolling mesas and precious running waters that at length unite in the Currumpaw River, from which the whole region is named. And the king whose despotic power was felt over its entire extent was an old gray wolf.<br>&nbsp;<br>Old Lobo, or the king, as the Mexicans called him, was the gigantic leader of a remarkable pack of gray wolves, that had ravaged the Currumpaw Valley for a number of years. All the shepherds and ranchmen knew him well, and, wherever he appeared with his trusty band, terror reigned supreme among the cattle, and wrath and despair among their owners. Old Lobo was a giant among wolves, and was cunning and strong in proportion to his size. His voice at night was well-known and easily distinguished from that of any of his fellows. An ordinary wolf might howl half the night about the herdsman's bivouac without attracting more than a passing notice, but when the deep roar of the old king came booming down the ca�on, the watcher bestirred himself and prepared to learn in the morning that fresh and serious inroads had been made among the herds.<br>&nbsp;<br>Old Lobo's band was but a small one. This I never quite understood, for usually, when a wolf rises to the position and power that he had, he attracts a numerous following. It may be that he had as many as he desired, or perhaps his ferocious temper prevented the increase of his pack. Certain is it that Lobo had only five followers during the latter part of his reign. Each of these, however, was a wolf of renown, most of them were above the ordinary size, one in particular, the second in command, was a veritable giant, but even he was far below the leader in size and prowess. Several of the band, besides the two leaders, were especially noted. One of those was a beautiful white wolf, that the Mexicans called Blanca; this was supposed to be a female, possibly Lobo's mate. Another was a yellow wolf of remarkable swiftness, which, according to current stories had, on several occasions, captured an antelope for the pack.<br>&nbsp;<br>It will be seen, then, that these wolves were thoroughly well-known to the cowboys and shepherds. They were frequently seen and oftener heard, and their lives were intimately associated with those of the cattlemen, who would so gladly have destroyed them. There was not a stockman on the Currumpaw who would not readily have given the value of many steers for the scalp of any one of Lobo's band, but they seemed to possess charmed lives, and defied all manner of devices to kill them. They scorned all hunters, derided all poisons, and continued, for at least five years, to exact their tribute from the Currumpaw ranchers to the extent, many said, of a cow each day. According to this estimate, therefore, the band had killed more than two thousand of the finest stock, for, as was only too well-known, they selected the best in every instance.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>The old idea that a wolf was constantly in a starving state, and therefore ready to eat anything, was as far as possible from the truth in this case, for these freebooters were always sleek and well-conditioned, and were in fact most fastidious about what they ate. Any animal that had died from natural causes, or that was diseased or tainted, they would not touch, and they even rejected anything that had been killed by the stockmen. Their choice and daily food was the tenderer part of a freshly killed yearling heifer. An old bull or cow they disdained, and though they occasionally took a young calf or colt, it was quite clear that veal or horseflesh was not their favorite diet. It was also known that they were not fond of mutton, although they often amused themselves by killing sheep. One night in November, 1893, Blanca and the yellow wolf killed two hundred and fifty sheep, apparently for the fun of it, and did not eat an ounce of their flesh.<br>&nbsp;<br>These are examples of many stories which I might repeat, to show the ravages of this destructive band. Many new devices for their extinction were tried each year, but still they lived and throve in spite of all the efforts of their foes. A great price was set on Lobo's head, and in consequence poison in a score of subtle forms was put out for him, but he never failed to detect and avoid it. One thing only he feared &#x2013; that was firearms, and knowing full well that all men in this region carried them, he never was known to attack or face a human being. Indeed, the set policy of his band was to take refuge in flight whenever, in the daytime, a man was descried, no matter at what distance. Lobo's habit of permitting the pack to eat only that which they themselves had killed, was in numerous cases their salvation, and the keenness of his scent to detect the taint of human hands or the poison itself, completed their immunity.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>On one occasion, one of the cowboys heard the too familiar rallying-cry of Old Lobo, and stealthily approaching, he found the Currumpaw pack in a hollow, where they had 'rounded up' a small herd of cattle. Lobo sat apart on a knoll, while Blanca with the rest was endeavoring to 'cut out' a young cow, which they had selected; but the cattle were standing in a compact mass with their heads outward, and presented to the foe a line of horns, unbroken save when some cow, frightened by a fresh onset of the wolves, tried to retreat into the middle of the herd. It was only by taking advantage of these breaks that the wolves had succeeded at all in wounding the selected cow, but she was far from being disabled, and it seemed that Lobo at length lost patience with his followers, for he left his position on the hill and, uttering a deep roar, dashed toward the herd. The terrified rank broke at his charge, and he sprang in among them. Then the cattle scattered like the pieces of a bursting bomb. Away went the chosen victim, but ere she had gone twenty-five yards Lobo was upon her. Seizing her by the neck he suddenly held back with all his force and so threw her heavily to the ground. The shock must have been tremendous, for the heifer was thrown heels over head. Lobo also turned somersault, but immediately recovered himself, and his followers falling on the poor cow, killed her in a few seconds. Lobo took no part in the killing &#x2013; after having thrown the victim, he seemed to say, "Now, why could not some of you have done that at once without wasting so much time?"<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>The man now rode up shouting, the wolves as usual retired, and he, having a bottle of strychnine, quickly poisoned the carcass in three places, then went away, knowing they would return to feed, as they had killed the animal themselves. But next morning, on going to look for his expected victims, he found that, although the wolves had eaten the heifer, they had carefully cut out and thrown aside all those parts that had been poisoned.<br>&nbsp;<br>The dread of this great wolf spread yearly among the ranchmen, and each year a larger price was set on his head, until at last it reached $1,000, an unparalleled wolf-bounty, surely; many a good man has been hunted down for less. Tempted by the promised reward, a Texan ranger named Tannerey came one day galloping up the ca�on of the old Currumpaw. He had a superb outfit for wolf-hunting &#x2013; the best of guns and horses, and a pack of enormous wolf-hounds. Far out on the plains of the Pan-handle, he and his dogs had killed many a wolf, and now he never doubted that, within a few days, old Lobo's scalp would dangle at his saddle-bow.<br>&nbsp;<br>Away they went bravely on their hunt in the gray dawn of a summer morning, and soon the great dogs gave joyous tongue to say that they were already on the track of their quarry. Within two miles, the grizzly band of Currumpaw leaped into view, and the chase grew fast and furious. The part of the wolf-hounds was merely to hold the wolves at bay till the hunter could ride up and shoot them, and this usually was easy on the open plains of Texas; but here a new feature of the country came into play, and showed how well Lobo had chosen his range; for the rocky ca�ons of the Currumpaw and its tributaries intersect the prairies in every direction. The old wolf at once made for the nearest of these and by crossing it got rid of the horsemen. His band then scattered and thereby scattered the dogs, and when they reunited at a distant point of course all of the dogs did not turn up, and the wolves no longer outnumbered, turned on their pursuers and killed or desperately wounded them all. That night when Tannerey mustered his dogs, only six of them returned, and of these, two were terribly lacerated. This hunter made two other attempts to capture the royal scalp, but neither of them was more successful than the first, and on the last occasion his best horse met its death by a fall; so he gave up the chase in disgust and went back to Texas, leaving Lobo more than ever the despot of the region.<br>&nbsp;<br>Next year, two other hunters appeared, determined to win the promised bounty. Each believed he could destroy this noted wolf, the first by means of a newly devised poison, which was to be laid out in an entirely new manner; the other a French Canadian, by poison assisted with certain spells and charms, for he firmly believed that Lobo was a veritable 'loupgarou,' and could not be killed by ordinary means.

When do social movements take off? Sexual harassment was once something that women had to endure; now a movement has risen up against it. White nationalist sentiments, on the other hand, were largely kept out of mainstream discourse; now there is no shortage of media outlets for them. In this book, with the help of behavioral economics, psychology, and other fields, Cass Sunstein casts a bright new light on how change happens.</p><p>Sunstein focuses on the crucial role of social norms&#x2015;and on their frequent collapse. When norms lead people to silence themselves, even an unpopular status quo can persist. Then one day, someone challenges the norm&#x2015;a child who exclaims that the emperor has no clothes; a woman who says &#x201c;me too.&#x201d; Sometimes suppressed outrage is unleashed, and long-standing practices fall. </p><p>Sometimes change is more gradual, as &#x201c;nudges&#x201d; help produce new and different decisions&#x2015;apps that count calories; texted reminders of deadlines; automatic enrollment in green energy or pension plans. Sunstein explores what kinds of nudges are effective and shows why nudges sometimes give way to bans and mandates. Finally, he considers social divisions, social cascades, and &#x201c;partyism,&#x201d; when identification with a political party creates a strong bias against all members of an opposing party&#x2015;which can both fuel and block social change.</p></p><p>Cass R.

And this is Rothbard's masterful account, the first full scholarly book on the topic and still the most definitive. It was his dissertation, published in 1962 but nearly impossible to get until this new edition, the first with the high production values associated with Mises Institute publications. <br><br> The American Economic Review was wild for this book when it appeared: "Rothbard's work represents the only published, book-length, academic treatise on the remedies that were proposed, debated, and enacted in attempts to copy with the crisis of 1819," the reviewer wrote. "As such, the book should certainly find a place on the shelf of the study of U.S. business cycles and of the economic historian who is interested in the early economic development of the United States."<br><br>And specialists have treasured the book for years. It is incredible to realized that some American historians think of MN Rothbard as the author of this book and nothing else! <br><br>Rothbard tells the story about a disaster that could not be attributed to some specific government blunder or disaster. It seemed to originate from within the economic system itself. Its cause was not obvious to observers at the time. Confronted with something new, the Panic engendered much discussion and debate about possible causes and remedies. As Rothbard observes, the panic provides "an instructive picture of a people coming to grips with the problems of a business depression, problems which, in modified forms, were to plague Americans until the present day."<br><br>There were many cranky and contradictory remedies proposed, and Rothbard reviews each one. But in the end, there was no widespread confusion on what caused the downturn. Instead, it was widely known that a false prosperity is a very dangerous thing. It always turns to bust. Bad legislation failed to pass, the government embarked on no New Deal planning, and there was no great reflat</p><p>The author of numerous books, the late Murray N. Rothbard (1926-1995) was the S.

Barbara Kingsolver credits her with shaping the history and politics of food in the United States. And countless others who have vied for a food revolution, pushed organics, and reawakened Americans to growing their own food and eating locally consider her both teacher and muse.Joan Gussow has influenced thousands through her books, <em>This Organic Life</em> and <em>The Feeding Web</em>, her lectures, and the simple fact that she lives what she preaches. Now in her eighties, she stops once more to pass along some wisdom-surprising, inspiring, and controversial-via the pen.</p> <p>Gussow's memoir <em>Growing, Older</em> begins when she loses her husband of 40 years to cancer and, two weeks later, finds herself skipping down the street-much to her alarm. Why wasn't she grieving in all the normal ways? With humor and wit, she explains how she stopped worrying about why she was smiling and went on worrying, instead, and as she always has, about the possibility that the world around her was headed off a cliff. But hers is not a tale, or message, of gloom. Rather it is an affirmation of a life's work-and work in general.</p> <p>Lacking a partner's assistance, Gussow continued the hard labor of growing her own year-round diet. She dealt single-handedly with a rising tidal river that regularly drowned her garden, with muskrat interlopers, broken appliances, bodily decay, and river trash-all the while bucking popular notions of how "an elderly widowed woman" ought to behave.</p> <p>Scattered throughout are urgent suggestions about what growing older on a changing planet will call on all of us to do: learn self-reliance and self-restraint, yield graciously if not always happily to necessity, and-since there is no other choice-come to terms with the insistencies of the natural world. Gussow delivers another literary gem-one that women curious about aging, gardeners curious about contending with increasingly intense weather, or environmentalists curious about the future will embrace.<br> <br> </p></p><p><p>Joan Gussow is a highly acclaimed nutrition educator who has demonstrated that year-round eating from 1,000 square feet in a suburban riverfront village is possible, life-sustaining, and delicious.

She assumed (as did others) that she would be grief-stricken, yet she found herself able to move into the next period of life with grace and anticipation. This is due in no small part to long-term differences the two experienced (although they seem minor), and to her rededication to gardening. It would be incorrect to classify this as a guide to plant care or landscape design, however, as Gussow's view on life and living is far too broad. She writes about removing pests from the yard and then shifts gears to discuss national food policy, share recipes for zucchini, and reminisce about her son and butterflies. She rails against humanity's interest only in itself, yet expresses pride in her ability to still heft bags of soil and rocks. Gussow is an octogenarian who will not go gently in any direction, and certainly won't be ignored.</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Library Journal-</strong></em></p> <p>Gussow (Mary Swartz Rose Professor Emerita &amp; former chair, nutrition dept., Columbia Univ.

He lives with his wife and three children in Hertfordshire, England.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>In the summer dusk, the encampment of the Mongols stretched for miles in every direction, the great gathering still dwarfed by the plain in the shadow of the black mountain. Ger tents speckled the landscape as far as the eye could see, and around them thousands of cooking fires lit the ground. Beyond those, herds of ponies, goats, sheep, and yaks stripped the ground of grass in their constant hunger. Each dawn saw them driven away to the river and good grazing before returning to the gers. Though Genghis guaranteed the peace, tension and suspicion grew each day. None there had seen such a host before, and it was easy to feel hemmed in by the numbers. Insults imaginary and real were exchanged as all felt the pressure of living too close to warriors they did not know. In the evenings, there were many fights between the young men, despite the prohibition. Each dawn found one or two bodies of those who had tried to settle an old score or grudge. The tribes muttered among themselves while they waited to hear why they had been brought so far from their own lands.<br><br>In the center of the army of tents and carts stood the ger of Genghis himself, unlike anything seen before on the plains. Half as high again as the others, it was twice the width and built of stronger materials than the wicker lattice of the gers around it. The construction had proved too heavy to dismantle easily and was mounted on a wheeled cart drawn by eight oxen. As the night came, many hundreds of warriors directed their feet toward it, just to confirm what they had heard and marvel.<br><br>Inside, the great ger was lit with mutton-oil lamps, casting a warm light over the inhabitants and making the air thick. The walls were hung with silk war banners, but Genghis disdained any show of wealth and sat on a rough wooden bench. His brothers lay sprawled on piled horse blankets and saddles, drinking and chatting idly.<br><br>Before Genghis sat a nervous young warrior, still sweating from the long ride that had brought him amongst such a host. The men around the khan did not seem to be paying attention, but the messenger was aware that their hands were never far from their weapons. They did not seem tense or worried at his presence, and he considered that their hands might always be near a blade. His people had made their decision and he hoped the elder khans knew what they were doing.<br><br>"If you have finished your tea, I will hear the message," Genghis said.<br><br>The messenger nodded, placing the shallow cup back on the floor at his feet. He swallowed his last gulp as he closed his eyes and recited, "These are the words of Barchuk, who is khan to the Uighurs."<br><br>The conversations and laughter around him died away as he spoke, and he knew they were all listening. His nervousness grew.<br><br>" 'It is with joy that I learned of your glory, my lord Genghis Khan. We had grown weary waiting for our people to know one another and rise. The sun has risen. The river is freed of ice. You are the gurkhan, the one who will lead us all. I will dedicate my strength and knowledge to you.' "<br><br>The messenger stopped and wiped sweat from his brow. When he opened his eyes, he saw that Genghis was looking at him quizzically and his stomach tightened in fear.<br><br>"The words are very fine," Genghis said, "but where are the Uighurs? They have had a year to reach this place. If I have to fetch them . . ." He left the threat dangling.<br><br>The messenger spoke quickly. "My lord, it took months just to build the carts to travel. We have not moved from our lands in many generations. Five great temples had to be taken apart, stone by stone, each one numbered so that it could be built again. Our store of scrolls took a dozen carts by itself and cannot move quickly."<br><br>"You have writing?" Genghis asked, sitting forward with interest.<br><br>The messenger nodded without pride. "For many years now, lord. We have collected the writings of nations in the west, whenever they have allowed us to trade for them. Our khan is a man of great learning and has even copied works of the Chin and the Xi Xia."<br><br>"So I am to welcome scholars and teachers to this place?" Genghis said. "Will you fight with scrolls?"<br><br>The messenger colored as the men in the ger chuckled. "There are four thousand warriors also, my lord. They will follow Barchuk wherever he leads them."<br><br>"They will follow me, or they will be left as flesh on the grass," Genghis replied.<br><br>For a moment, the messenger could only stare, but then he dropped his eyes to the polished wooden floor and remained silent.<br><br>Genghis stifled his irritation. "You have not said when they will come, these Uighur scholars," he said.<br><br>"They could be only days behind me, lord. I left three moons ago and they were almost ready to leave. It cannot be long now, if you will have patience."<br><br>"For four thousand, I will wait," Genghis said softly, thinking. "You know the Chin writing?"<br><br>"I do not have my letters, lord. My khan can read their words."<br><br>"Do these scrolls say how to take a city made of stone?"<br><br>The messenger hesitated as he felt the sharp interest of the men around him.<br><br>"I have not heard of anything like that, lord. The Chin write about philosophy, the words of the Buddha, Confucius, and Lao Tzu. They do not write of war, or if they do, they have not allowed us to see those scrolls."<br><br>"Then they are of no use to me," Genghis snapped. "Get yourself a meal and be careful not to start a fight with your boasting. I will judge the Uighurs when they finally arrive."<br><br>The messenger bowed low before leaving the ger, taking a relieved breath as soon as he was out of the smoky atmosphere. Once more he wondered if his khan understood what he had promised with his words. The Uighur ruled themselves no longer.<br><br>Looking around at the vast encampment, the messenger saw twinkling lights for miles. At a word from the man he had met, they could be sent in any direction. Perhaps the khan of the Uighurs had not had a choice.<br><br>Hoelun dipped her cloth into a bucket and laid it on her son's brow. Temuge had always been weaker than his brothers, and it seemed an added burden that he fell sick more than Khasar or Kachiun, or Temujin himself. She smiled wryly at the thought that she must now call her son "Genghis." It meant the ocean and was a beautiful word twisted beyond its usual meaning by his ambition. He who had never seen the sea in his twenty-six years of life. Not that she had herself, of course.<br><br>Temuge stirred in his sleep, wincing as she probed his stomach with her fingers.<br><br>"He is quiet now. Perhaps I will leave for a time," Borte said. Hoelun glanced coldly at the woman Temujin had taken as a wife. Borte had given him four perfect sons and for a time Hoelun had thought they would be as sisters, or at least friends. The younger woman had once been full of life and excitement, but events had twisted her somewhere deep, where it could not be seen. Hoelun knew the way Temujin looked at the eldest boy. He did not play with little Jochi and all but ignored him. Borte had fought against the mistrust, but it had grown between them like an iron wedge into strong wood. It did not help that his three other boys had all inherited the yellow eyes of his line. Jochi's were a dark brown, as black as his hair in dim light. While Temujin doted on the others, it was Jochi who ran to his mother, unable to understand the coldness in his father's face when he looked at him. Hoelun saw the young woman glance at the door to the ger, no doubt thinking of her sons.<br><br>"You have servants to put them to bed," Hoelun chided. "If Temuge wakes, I will need you here."<br><br>As she spoke her fingers drifted over a dark knot under the skin of her son's belly, just a few fingerbreadths above the dark hair of his groin. She had seen such an injury before, when men lifted weights too heavy for them. The pain was crippling, but most of them recovered. Temuge did not have that kind of luck, and never had. He looked less like a warrior than ever as he had grown to manhood. When he slept, he had the face of a poet, and she loved him for that. Perhaps because his father would have rejoiced to see the men the others had become, she had always found a special tenderness for Temuge. He had not grown ruthless, though he had endured as much as they. She sighed to herself and felt Borte's eyes on her in the gloom.<br><br>"Perhaps he will recover," Borte said.<br><br>Hoelun winced. Her son blistered under the sun and rarely carried a blade bigger than an eating knife. She had not minded as he began to learn the histories of the tribes, taking them in with such speed that the older men were amazed at his recall. Not everyone could be skilled with weapons and horses, she told herself. She knew he hated the sneers and gibes that followed him in his work, though there were few who dared risk Genghis hearing of them. Temuge refused to mention the insults and that was a form of courage all its own. None of her sons lacked spirit.<br><br>Both women looked up as the small door of the ger opened. Hoelun frowned as she saw Kokchu enter and bow his head to them. His fierce eyes darted over the supine figure of her son, and she fought not to show her dislike, not even understanding her own reaction. There was something about the shaman that set her teeth on edge, and she had ignored the messengers he had sent. For a moment, she drew herself up, struggling between indignation and weariness.<br><br>"I did not ask for you," she said coldly.<br><br>Kokchu seemed oblivious to the tone. "I sent a slave to beg a moment with you, mother to khans. Perhaps he has not yet arrived. The whole camp is talking of your son's illness."<br><br>Hoelun felt the shaman's gaze fasten on her, waiting to be formally welcomed as she looked at T...</p><h2>Everybody&#39;s Got Something</h2><p><i>"Regardless of how much money you have, your race, where you live, what religion you follow, you are going through something. Or you already have or you will. As momma always said, "Everybody's got something." </i><br><br>So begins beloved Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts's new memoir in which she recounts the incredible journey that's been her life so far, and the lessons she's learned along the way. With grace, heart, and humor, she writes about overcoming breast cancer only to learn five years later that she will need a bone marrow transplant to combat a rare blood disorder, the grief and heartbreak she suffered when her mother passed away, her triumphant return to GMA after her medical leave, and the tremendous support and love of her family and friends that saw her through her difficult times. <br><br>Following her mother's advice to "make your mess your message," Robin taught a nation of viewers that while it is true that we've all got something -- a medical crisis to face, aging parents to care for, heartbreak in all its many forms --- we've also all got something to give: hope, encouragement, a life-saving transplant or a spirit-saving embrace. As Robin has learned, and what readers of her remarkable story will come to believe as well, it's all about faith, family and friends. And finding out that you are stronger, much stronger, than you think.</p><p><strong>Robin Roberts</strong> is the anchor of ABC's morning show <em>Good Morning America</em>.

A graduate of Simon's Rock College at Bard, she lives with her husband and daughter in Hoboken, New Jersey.When Good Morning America cohost Roberts was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007, she mounted a very public battle. Five years after completing treatment, she faced a rare bone-marrow disorder, likely caused by the cancer treatment, that again tested her strength and resolve, again in public. Following her mother&#x2019;s time-honored advice to &#x201c;make your mess your message,&#x201d; Roberts offers an inspiring memoir of her life, from her home base in Mississippi to her home in New York and the glamorous though grueling life of a television reporter. Roberts prevailed through a painful bone-marrow transplant, with her sister as donor; the death of her mother; and her triumphant return to GMA after her medical leave, proudly wearing her bald head on air. With the infectious personality for which she&#x2019;s known, Roberts details the support of family and friends and the people she&#x2019;s met in her life and career who&#x2019;ve inspired her by overcoming their own challenges with the &#x201c;something&#x201d; that everybody inevitably faces.

Thankfully, this attitude is changing, and children and parents are all the happier for it.

Are you speechless with awe when you see the Milky Way strewn with stars? Do you find it hard to conceive of a divinity separate from the beauty of nature or the power of the universe? Then you are probably a pantheist. The heart of Pantheism is reverence for Nature and the Universe. It offers a vibrant alternative to theism and atheism, with a joyful and accepting approach to life on this earth. Pantheism dates back to the very first Greek philosophers, and was the religious viewpoint of many famous thinkers and artists, including Marcus Aurelius, Spinoza, Wordsworth, Whitman, Emerson, Thoreau, Einstein, and Frank Lloyd Wright. The dominant religious approach of the nineteenth century, pantheism is seeing a modern revival as the underlying world view of the environmental movement, of leading scientists, and of nature-revering paganism. This accessible, clear and authoritative handbook is the only available introduction to the history, theory and practice of Pantheism. &#34;Surely one of the most extraordinary books written in recent years about the subject of religion.&#34; --Dr. Bill Bruehl, Amazon Books</p><p>International award-winning author Dr Paul Harrison is the creator of the Web&#39;s two largest sites on pantheism and the founder and president of the World Pantheist Movement. He is an environmental writer, and author of six books on environment, population, development and agriculture.</p>
